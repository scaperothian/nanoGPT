  "Ain\u2019t No Man Righteous, No Not One": 'When a man he serves the Lord, it makes
    his life worthwhile

    It don''t matter ''bout his position, it don''t matter ''bout his lifestyle

    Talk about perfection, I ain''t never seen none

    And there ain''t no man righteous, no not one


    Sometimes the devil likes to drive you from the neighborhood

    He''ll even work his ways through those whose intentions are good

    Some like to worship on the moon, others are worshipping the sun

    And there ain''t no man righteous, no not one


    Look around, ya see so many social hypocrites

    Like to make rules for others while they do just the opposite


    You can''t get to glory by the raising and the lowering of no flag

    Put your goodness next to God''s and it comes out like a filthy rag

    In a city of darkness there''s no need of the sun

    And there ain''t no man righteous, no not one


    Done so many evil things in the name of love that it''s a crying shame

    I never did see no fire that could put out a flame


    Pull your hat down, baby, pull the wool down over your eyes

    Keep a-talking, baby, ''til you run right out of alibis

    Someday you''ll account for all the deeds that you done

    When I''m gone don''t wonder where I be

    Just say that I trusted in God and that Christ was in me

  All or Nothing at All: '[Verse 1]

    All or nothing at all

    Half a love never appealed to me

    If your heart never could yield to me

    Then I''d rather have nothing at all


    [Verse 2]

    All or nothing at all

    If it''s love there is no in-between

    Why begin then cry for something that might have been

    No, I''d rather have nothing at all


    [Bridge]

    Please don''t bring your lips so close to my cheek

    Don''t smile, I''ll be lost beyond recall

    The kiss in your eyes and the touch of your hand makes me weak

    And my heart may grow dizzy and fall


    [Verse 3]

    And if I fell under the spell of your call

    I would be caught in the undertow

    And so you see, I''ve got to say "No, no"

  Arthur McBride: '[Verse 1]

    Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride

    As we went a-walking down by the seaside

    Now mark what followed and what did betide

    For it being on Christmas morning


    [Verse 2]

    Now, for recreation, we went on a tramp

    And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp

    And a little wee drummer intending to camp

    For the day being pleasant and charming


    [Verse 3]

    "Good morning, good morning," the Sergeant he cried

    "And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply

    Intending no harm but meant to pass by

    For it being on Christmas morning


    [Verse 4]

    "But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist

    Ten guineas in gold I''ll stick in your fist

    And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust

    And drink the king''s health in the morning


    [Verse 5]

    For a soldier, he leads a very fine life

    And he always is blessed with a charming young wife

    And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife

    And he always lives pleasant and charming

    See Bob Dylan LiveGet tickets as low as $57You might also like[Verse 6]

    And a soldier, he always is decent and clean

    In the finest of clothing he''s constantly seen

    While other poor fellows go dirty and mean

    And sup on thin gruel in the morning."


    [Instrumental Interlude]


    [Verse 7]

    "But," says Arthur, "I wouldn''t be proud of your clothes

    For you''ve only the lend of them, as I suppose

    But you dare not change them one night, for you know

    If you do, you''ll be flogged in the morning


    [Verse 8]

    And although that we''re single and free

    We take great delight in our own company

    We have no desire strange places to see

    Although that your offers are charming


    [Verse 9]

    And we have no desire to take your advance

    All hazards and dangers we barter on chance

    For you''d have no scruples for to send us to France

    Where we would get shot without warning."

    [Verse 10]

    "Oh no," says the Sergeant. "I''ll have no such chat

    And neither will I take it from snappy young brats

    For if you insult me with one other word

    I''ll cut off your heads in the morning."


    [Verse 11]

    And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs

    And we scarce gave them time to draw their own blades

    When a trusty shillelagh came over their head

    And bid them take that as fair warning


    [Verse 12]

    And their old rusty rapiers that hung by their sides

    We flung them as far as we could in the tide

    "Now take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride

    "And temper their edge in the morning!"


    [Verse 13]

    And the little wee drummer, we flattened his bow

    And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow

    Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll

    And bade it a tedious returning


    [Verse 14]

    And we having no money, paid them off in cracks

    We paid no respect to their two bloody backs

    And we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks

    And left them for dead in the morning

    [Verse 15]

    And so, to conclude and to finish disputes

    We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits

    For we were the lads who would give them hard clouts

    And bid them look sharp in the morning

  Ballad in Plain D: '[Verse 1]

    I once loved a girl, her skin it was bronze

    With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn

    I courted her proudly but now she is gone

    Gone as the season she''s taken


    [Verse 2]

    In a young summer''s youth, I stole her away

    From her mother and sister, though close did they stay

    Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day

    With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us


    [Verse 3]

    Of the two sisters, I loved the young

    With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one

    Their constant scrapegoat, she was easily undone

    By the jealousy of others around her


    [Verse 4]

    For her parasite sister, I had no respect

    Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect

    Countless visions of the other she''d reflect

    As a crutch for her scenes and her society


    [Verse 5]

    Myself, for what I did, I cannot be excused

    The changes I was going through can''t even be used

    For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose

    The could-be dream-lover of my lifetime

    With unseen consciousness, I possessed in my grip

    A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped

    Noticing not that I''d already slipped

    To the sin of love''s false security


    [Verse 7]

    From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace

    Answers of emptiness voice vacancies

    ''Til the tombstones of damage read no questions but please

    What''s wrong, what''s exactly the matter?


    [Verse 8]

    And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen

    The timeless explosion of fantasy''s dream

    At the peak of the night, the king and the queen

    Tumbled all down into pieces


    [Verse 9]

    "The tragic figure" her sister did shout

    "Leave her alone, God damn you, get out"

    And I in my armor, turning about

    And nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness


    [Verse 10]

    Beneath a bare light bulb the plaster did pound

    Her sister and I in a screaming battleground

    And she in between, the victim of sound

    Soon shattered as a child to the shadows

    [Verse 11]

    All is gone, all is gone, admit it, take flight

    I gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight

    My mind it was mangled, I ran into the night

    Leaving all of love''s ashes behind me


    [Verse 12]

    The wind knocks my window, the room it is wet

    The words to say I''m sorry, I haven''t found yet

    I think of her often and hope whoever she''s met

    Will be fully aware of how precious she is


    [Verse 13]

    Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me

    "How good, how good does it feel to be free?"

    And I answer them most mysteriously

    "Are birds free from the chains of the skyway?"'
  Ballad of Donald White: 'My name is Donald White, you see

    When the moon is shining clear

    I landed in the old Northwest

    Seattle, Washington

    Although I''d a-traveled many miles

    I never made a friend

    For I could never get along in life

    With people that I met


    If I had some education

    To give me a decent start

    I might have been a doctor or

    A master in the arts

    But I used my hands for stealing

    When I was very young

    And they locked me down in jailhouse cells

    and the prisoners

    I found they were my kind

    And it was there inside the bars

    I found my peace of mind

    But the jails they were too crowded

    Institutions overflowed

    So they turned me loose to walk upon

    Life''s hurried tangled road


    And there''s danger on the ocean

    Where the salt sea waves split high

    And there''s danger on the battlefield

    Where the shells of bullets fly

    And there''s danger in this open world

    Where men strive to be free

    And for me the greatest danger

    Was in society


    So I asked them to send me back

    To the institution home

    But they said they were too crowded

    For me they had no room

    I got down on my knees and begged

    "Oh, please put me away,"

    But they would not listen to my plea

    Or nothing I would say

    And so it was on Christmas eve

    In the year of ''59

    It was on that night I killed a man

    I did not try to hide

    The jury found me guilty

    And I won''t disagree

    For I knew that it would happen

    If I wasn''t put away


    And I''m glad I''ve had no parents

    To care for me or cry

    For now they will never know

    The horrible death I die

    And I''m also glad I''ve had no friends

    To see me in disgrace

    For they''ll never see that hangman''s hood

    Wrap around my face


    Farewell unto the old north woods

    Of which I used to roam

    Farewell unto the crowded bars

    Of which''ve been my home

    Farewell to all you people

    Who think the worst of me

    I guess you''ll feel much better when

    I''m on that hanging tree

    But there''s just one question

    Before they kill me dead

    I''m wondering just how much

    To you I really said

    Concerning all the boys that come

    Down a road like me

    Are they enemies or victims

    Of your society?'

    When green buds all were swelling

    Sweet William on his death bed lay

    For love of Barbara Allen


    He sent his servant to the town

    To the place where she was dwelling

    Saying you must come, to my master dear

    If your name be Barbara Allen


    So slowly, slowly she got up

    And slowly she drew nigh him

    And the only words to him did say

    "Young man, I think you''re dying"


    He turned his face unto the wall

    And death was in him welling

    Goodbye, goodbye, to my friends all

    Be good to Barbara Allen


    When he was dead and laid in grave

    She heard the death bells knelling

    And every stroke to her did say

  Belle Isle: '[Verse 1]

    One evening for pleasure I rambled to view

    The fair fields all alone

    Down by the banks of Loch Eiron

    Where beauty and pleasure were known


    [Verse 2]

    I spied a fair maid at her labour

    Which caused me to stay for a while

    And I thought of a goddess to beauty

    Bloomin'' bright star of Bright Isle


    [Verse 3]

    I humbled myself to her beauty

    "Fair maiden, where do you belong?

    Are you from heaven descended

    Abiding in Cupid''s fair throne?"


    [Verse 4]

    "Young man, I will tell you a secret

    It''s true I''m a maid that is poor

    And to part from my vows and my promise

    Is more than my heart can endure


    [Verse 5]

    Therefore I remain at my service

    And go through all my hardship and toil

    And wait for the lad that has left me

    All alone on the banks of Belle Isle."

    Hezekiah Jones lived in a place... in Arkansas

    He never had too much, except he had some land

    An'' he had a couple of hogs and things like that

    He never had much money

    But he''d spend what he did make as fast as he made it

    So it never really mattered that he had much money

    But in a cupboard there, he kept in the cupboard...

    He kept in the cupboard books

    He called the books his "rainy season."

    The white folks around the county there talked about Hezekiah...

    They... said, "Well... old Hezekiah, he''s harmless enough

    But the way I see it he better put down them goddam books

    Readin'' ain''t no good, for nigga is nigga."

    One day the white man''s preacher came around

    Knockin'' on doors, knockin'' on all the doors in the county

    He knocked on Hezekiah''s door

    He says, "Hezekiah, you believe in the Lord?"

    Hezekiah says, "Well, I don''t know, I never really SEEN the Lord

    I can''t say, yes, I do..."

    He says, "Hezekiah, you believe in the Church?"

    Hezekiah says, "Well, the Church is divided, ain''t they

    And... they can''t make up their minds

    I''m just like them, I can''t make up mine either."

    He says, "Hezekiah, you believe that if a man is good Heaven is his last reward?"

    Hezekiah says, "I''m good... good as my neighbor."

    "You don''t believe in nothin''," said the white man''s preacher

    You don''t believe in nothin''!"

    "Oh yes, I do," says Hezekiah

    "I believe that a man should be indebted to his neighbors

    Not for the reward of a Heaven or fear of hellfire."

    "There''s a lot of good ways for a man to be wicked..."

    [Verse 6]

    Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight

    Till he came to a river raging

    And there he spied his darling bride

    In the arms of Black Jack Davey

    Wrapped up with Black Jack Davey

    All made of Spanish leather

    Get behind me on my horse

    Made of Spanish leather

    Got behind him on his horse

    And they rode off together

    They rode off together

    "Would you forsake your house and home

    Would you forsake your baby?

    Would you forsake your husband, too

    To go with Black Jack Davey

    Rode off with Black Jack Davey?"

    I''ll forsake my husband, too

    For the love of Black Jack Davey

    Between my husband and baby

    Tonight I lay on the river banks

    I was riding on the Mayflower

    When I thought I spied some land

    [*Laughter*]

    Start again

    Wait a minute now

    Okay, take two


    [Verse 1]

    I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land

    I yelled for Captain Arab, I have you understand

    Who came running to the deck, said, "Boys, forget the whale

    Look on over yonder, cut the engines, change the sail

    Haul on the bowline", we sang that melody

    Like all tough sailors do when they''re far away at sea


    [Verse 2]

    "I think I''ll call it America," I said as we hit land

    I took a deep breath, I fell down, I could not stand

    Captain Arab he started writing up some deeds

    He said, "Let''s set up a fort and start buyin'' a place with beads"

    Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon

    He throws us all in jail for carrying harpoons


    [Verse 3]

    Ah, me I busted out, don''t even ask me how

    I went to get some help, I walked by a Guernsey cow

    Who directed me down to the Bowery slums

    Where people carried signs around sayin'', "Ban the bums"

    I jumped right into line sayin'' "I hope that I''m not late"

    When I realized I hadn''t eaten for five days straight

    I went into a restaurant looking for the cook

    I told him I was the editor of a famous etiquette book

    The waitress he was handsome, he wore a powder blue cape

    I ordered some Suzette, I said "could you please make that Crepe?"

    Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boilin'' fat

    Food was flyin'' everywhere, I left without my hat


    [Verse 5]

    Now, I didn''t mean to be nosy but I went into a bank

    To get some bail for Arab and all the boys back in the tank

    They asked me for some collateral and I pulled down my pants

    They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France

    Who invited me to her house, I went but she had a friend

    Who knocked me out and robbed my boots and I was on the street again


    [Verse 6]

    Well, I rapped upon a house with the U.S. flag upon display

    I said, "Could you help me out, I got some friends down the way"

    "The man says, "Get out of here, I''ll tear you limb from limb"

    I said, "You know they refused Jesus, too", he said, "You''re not Him

    Get out of here before I break your bones, I ain''t your pop"

    I decided to have him arrested and I went lookin'' for a cop


    [Verse 7]

    I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab

    I went out the other door, this Englishman said, "Fab"

    As he saw me leap a hot dog stand and a chariot that stood

    Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood

    I ran right through the front door like a hobo sailor does

    But it was just a funeral parlor and the man asked me who I was

    [Verse 8]

    I repeated that my friends were all in jail with a sigh

    He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die"

    I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street

    When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet

    A pay phone was ringing and it just about blew my mind

    When I picked it up and said hello, this foot came through the line


    [Verse 9]

    Well, by this time I''s fed up at tryin'' to make a stab

    At bringing back any help for my friends and Captain Arab

    I decided to flip a coin like either heads or tails

    Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail

    So I hocked my sailor suit and I got a coin to flip

    It came up tails, it rhymed with sails, so I made it back to the ship


    [Verse 10]

    Well, I got back and took the parking ticket off the mast

    I was ripping it to shreds when this coastguard boat went past

    They asked me my name and I said, "Captain Kidd"

    They believed me but they wanted to know what exactly that I did

    I said for the Pope of Eruke I was employed

    They let me go right away, they were very paranoid


    [Verse 11]

    Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale

    That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail

    But the funniest thing was when I was leavin'' the bay

    I saw three ships sailin'' there, were all heading my way

    I asked the captain what his name was and how come he didn''t drive a truck

    He said his name was Columbus, I just said, "Good luck"1'

  Canadee-I-O: '[Verse 1]

    Well, it''s all of fair and handsome girl

    She''s all in her tender years

    She fell in love with a sailor boy

    It''s true she loved him well

    For to go off to sea with him

    Like she did not know how

    She longed to see that seaport town

    Of Canadee-i-o


    [Verse 2]

    So she bargained with the sailor boy

    All for a piece of gold

    Straightaway then he led her

    Down into the hold

    Sayin'', "I''ll dress you up in sailor''s clothes

    Your jacket shall be blue

    You''ll see that seaport town

    Of Canadee-i-o


    [Verse 3]

    Now, when the other sailors heard the news

    Well, they fell into a rage

    And with all the ship''s company

    They were willing to engage

    Saying, "We''ll tie her hands and feet, my boys

    Overboard we''ll throw her

    Scarcely ''bout half a year

    She''s married this bold captain

    Who called her his dear

    She''s dressed in silks and satins now

    She cuts a gallant show

  Changing of the Guards: '[Verse 1]

    Sixteen years, sixteen banners united over the fields

    Where the good shepherd grieves

    Desperate men, desperate women divided

    Spreading their wings ''neath falling leaves


    [Verse 2]

    Fortune calls, I stepped forth from the shadows to the marketplace

    Merchants and thieves, hungry for power, my last deal gone down

    She''s smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born

    On Midsummer''s Eve near the tower


    [Verse 3]

    The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration

    Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid

    Whose ebony face is beyond communication

    The captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid


    [Verse 4]

    They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo

    A messenger arrived with a black nightingale

    I seen her on the stairs and I couldn''t help but follow

    Follow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil


    [Verse 5]

    I stumbled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches

    With the stitches still mending ''neath a heart-shaped tattoo

    Renegade priests and treacherous young witches

    Were handing out the flowers that I''d given to you

    She wakes him up, forty-eight hours later the sun is breaking

    Near broken chains, mountain laurel and rolling rocks

    She''s begging to know what measures he now will be taking

    He''s pulling her down and she''s clutching onto his long golden locks

    Gentlemen, he said I don''t need your organization, I''ve shined your shoes

    I''ve moved your mountains and marked your cards

    But Eden is burning either get ready for elimination

    Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards


    [Verse 9]

    Peace will come with tranquility and splendor on the wheels of fire

    But will offer no reward when her false idols fall

    And cruel death surrenders with its pale ghost retreating

    Between the King and the Queen of Swords4'
  Chimes of Freedom: '[Verse 1]

    Far between sundown''s finish and midnight''s broken toll

    We ducked inside the doorways, thunder went crashing

    As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds

    Seemin'' to be the chimes of freedom flashing

    Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight

    Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight

    And for each and every underdog soldier in the night

    And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing


    [Verse 2]

    Through the city''s melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched

    With faces hidden as the walls were tightening

    As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin'' rain

    Dissolved into the bells of the lightning

    Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake

    Tolling for the luckless, they abandoned and forsaked

    Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake

    And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing


    [Verse 3]

    Through the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail

    The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder

    That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze

    Leavin'' only bells of lightning and it''s thunder

    Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind

    Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind

    And the poet and the painter far behind his rightful time

    Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute

    For the mistreated, mateless mother, the mistitled prostitute

    For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit

    And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing


    [Verse 5]

    Even though a cloud''s white curtain in a far-off corner flared

    And the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting

    Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones

    Condemned to drift or else be kept from driftin''

    Tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trail

    For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale

    And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail

    And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing


    [Verse 6]

    Starry-eyed and laughing as I recall when we were caught

    Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended

    As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look

    Spellbound and swallowed ''til the tolling ended

    Tolling for the aching whose wounds cannot be nursed

    For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse

  Gates of Eden: '[Verse 1]

    Of war and peace the truth just twists

    Its curfew gull it glides

    Upon four-legged forest clouds

    The cowboy angel rides

    With his candle lit into the sun

    Though its glow is waxed in black

    All except when ''neath the trees of Eden


    [Verse 2]

    The lamppost stands with folded arms

    Its iron claws attached

    To curbs ''neath holes where babies wail

    Though it shadows metal badge

    All and all can only fall

    With a crashing but meaningless blow

    No sound ever comes from the Gates of Eden

    The savage soldier sticks his head in sand

    And then complains

    Unto the shoeless hunter who''s gone deaf

    While paupers change possessions

    Each one wishing for what the other has got

    And the princess and the prince discuss

    What''s real and what is not

    It doesn''t matter inside the Gates of Eden

    A bed that is never mine

  Grammy Speech, 2015 from NYT: "FEBRUARY 7, 2015, 2:13 PM _\nThere are a few people\
    \ we need to thank tonight for bringing about this grand event. Neil Portnow,\
    \ Dana Tamarkin, Rob Light, Brian Greenbaum, Don Was. And also want to thank President\
    \ Carter for coming. It\u2019s been a long night, and I don\u2019t want to talk\
    \ too much, but I\u2019ll say a few things. I'm glad for my songs to be honored\
    \ like this. But you know, they didn't get here by themselves. It's been a long\
    \ road and it's taken a lot of doing. These songs of mine, I think of as mystery\
    \ plays, the kind that Shakespeare saw when he was growing up. I think you could\
    \ trace what I do back that far. They were on the fringes then, and I think they're\
    \ on the fringes now. And they sound like they've been traveling on hard ground.\
    \ I need to mention a few people along the way who brought this about. I know\
    \ I should mention John Hammond, the great talent scout, who way back when brought\
    \ me to Columbia Records. He signed me to that label when I was nobody. It took\
    \ a lot of faith to do that, and he took a lot of ridicule, but he was his own\
    \ man and he was courageous. And for that, I'm eternally grateful. The last person\
    \ he discovered before me was Aretha Franklin, and before that Count Basie, Billie\
    \ Holiday and a whole lot of other artists. All non-commercial artists. Trends\
    \ did not interest John, and I was very noncommercial but he stayed with me. He\
    \ believed in my talent and that's all that mattered. I can't thank him enough\
    \ for that. Lou Levy ran Leeds Music, and they published my earliest songs, but\
    \ I didn't stay there too long. Levy himself, he went back a long ways. He signed\
    \ me to that company and recorded my songs and I sang them into a tape recorder.\
    \ He told me outright, there was no precedent for what I was doing, that I was\
    \ either before my time or behind it. And if I brought him a song like \"Stardust,\"\
    \ he'd turn it down because it would be too late. He told me that if I was before\
    \ my time -- and he didn't really know that for sure -- but if it was happening\
    \ and if it was true, the public would usually take three to five years to catch\
    \ up -- so be prepared. And that did happen. The trouble was, when the public\
    \ did catch up I was already three to five years beyond that, so it kind of complicated\
    \ it. But he was encouraging, and he didn't judge me, and I'll always remember\
    \ him for that. Artie Mogull at Witmark Music signed me next to his company, and\
    \ he told me to just keep writing songs no matter what, that I might be on to\
    \ something. Well, he too stood behind me, and he could never wait to see what\
    \ I'd give him next. I didn't even think of myself as a songwriter before then.\
    \ I'll always be grateful for him also for that attitude.I also have to mention\
    \ some of the early artists who recorded my songs very, very early, without having\
    \ to be asked. Just something they felt about them that was right for them. I've\
    \ got to say thank you to Peter, Paul and Mary, who I knew all separately before\
    \ they ever became a group. I didn't even think of myself as writing songs for\
    \ others to sing but it was starting to happen and it couldn't have happened to,\
    \ or with, a better group. They took a song of mine that had been recorded before\
    \ that was buried on one of my records and turned it into a hit song. Not the\
    \ way I would have done it -- they straightened it out. But since then hundreds\
    \ of people have recorded it and I don't think that would have happened if it\
    \ wasn't for them. They definitely started something for me. The Byrds, the Turtles,\
    \ Sonny & Cher -- they made some of my songs Top 10 hits but I wasn't a pop songwriter\
    \ and I really didn't want to be that, but it was good that it happened. Their\
    \ versions of my songs were like commercials, but I didn't really mind that because\
    \ 50 years later my songs were being used in the commercials. So that was good\
    \ too. I was glad it happened, and I was glad they'd done it. Pervis Staples and\
    \ the Staple Singers -- long before they were on Stax they were on Epic and they\
    \ were one of my favorite groups of all time. I met them all in '62 or '63. They\
    \ heard my songs live and Pervis wanted to record three or four of them and he\
    \ did with the Staples Singers. They were the type of artists that I wanted recording\
    \ my songs, if anybody was going to do it. Nina Simone. I used to cross paths\
    \ with her in New York City in the Village Gate nightclub. She was an artist a\
    \ definitely looked up to. She recorded some of my songs that she learned directly\
    \ from me, sitting in a dressing room. She was an overwhelming artist, piano player\
    \ and singer. Very strong woman, very outspoken and dynamite to see perform. That\
    \ she was recording my songs validated everything that I was about. Nina was the\
    \ kind of artist that I loved and admired. Oh, and can't forget Jimi Hendrix.\
    \ I actually saw Jimi Hendrix perform when he was in a band called Jimmy James\
    \ and the Blue Flames -- something like that. And Jimi didn't even sing. He was\
    \ just the guitar player. After he became famous, he took some small songs of\
    \ mine that nobody paid any attention to and pumped them up into the outer limits\
    \ of the stratosphere and turned them all into classics. I have to thank Jimi,\
    \ too. I wish he was here. Johnny Cash recorded some of my songs early on, too,\
    \ I met him in about '63, when he was all skin and bones. He traveled long, he\
    \ traveled hard, but he was a hero of mine. I heard many of his songs growing\
    \ up. I knew them better than I knew my own. \"Big River,\" \"I Walk the Line.\"\
    \ \"How High\u2019s The Water, Mama?\" I wrote \"It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\"\
    \ with that song reverberating inside my head. I still ask, \"How high is the\
    \ water, mama?\" Johnny was an intense character. And he saw that people were\
    \ putting me down playing electric music, and he posted letters to magazines scolding\
    \ people, telling them to shut up and let him sing. In Johnny Cash's world --\
    \ hardcore Southern drama -- that kind of thing didn't exist. Nobody told anybody\
    \ what to sing or do. They just didn't do that kind of thing where he came from.\
    \ I'm always going to thank him for that. Johnny Cash was a giant of a man, the\
    \ man in black. And I'll always cherish the friendship we had until the day there\
    \ is no more days. Oh, and I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Joan Baez. She was\
    \ the queen of folk music then and now. She took a liking to my songs and brought\
    \ me with her to play concerts, where she had crowds of thousands of people enthralled\
    \ with her beauty and voice. People would say, \"What are you doing with that\
    \ ragtag scrubby looking waif?\" And she'd tell everybody in no uncertain terms,\
    \ \"Now you better be quiet and listen to the songs.\" We even played a few of\
    \ them together. Joan Baez is as tough-minded as they come. Loyal, free minded\
    \ and fiercely independent. Nobody can tell her what to do if she doesn't want\
    \ to do it. I learned a lot of things from her. A woman of devastating honesty.\
    \ And for her kind of love and devotion, I could never pay that back. These songs\
    \ didn't come out of thin air. I didn't just make them up out of whole cloth.\
    \ Contrary to what Lou Levy said, there was a precedent. It all came out of traditional\
    \ music: traditional folk music, traditional rock 'n' roll and traditional big-band\
    \ swing orchestra music. I learned lyrics and how to write them from listening\
    \ to folk songs. And I played them, and I met other people that played them, back\
    \ when nobody was doing it. Sang nothing but these folk songs, and they gave me\
    \ the code for everything that's fair game, that everything belongs to everyone.\
    \ For three or four years all I listened to were folk standards. I went to sleep\
    \ singing folk songs. I sang them everywhere, clubs, parties, bars, coffeehouses,\
    \ fields, festivals. And I met other singers along the way who did the same thing\
    \ and we just learned songs from each other. I could learn one song and sing it\
    \ next in an hour if I'd heard it just once. If you sang \"John Henry\" as many\
    \ times as me -- \"John Henry was a steel-driving man / Died with a hammer in\
    \ his hand / John Henry said a man ain't nothin' but a man / Before I let that\
    \ steam drill drive me down / I'll die with that hammer in my hand.\"If you had\
    \ sung that song as many times as I did, you'd have written \"How many roads must\
    \ a man walk down?\" too. Big Bill Broonzy had a song called \"Key to the Highway.\"\
    \ \"I've got a key to the highway / I'm booked and I'm bound to go / Gonna leave\
    \ here runnin' because walking is most too slow.\" I sang that a lot. If you sing\
    \ that a lot, you just might write, Georgia Sam he had a bloody nose Welfare Department\
    \ they wouldn\u2019t give him no clothes He asked poor Howard where can I go Howard\
    \ said there\u2019s only one place I know Sam said tell me quick man I got to\
    \ run Howard just pointed with his gun And said that way down on Highway 61 You'd\
    \ have written that too if you'd sang \"Key to the Highway\" as much as me. \"\
    Ain't no use sit 'n cry / You'll be an angel by and by / Sail away, ladies, sail\
    \ away.\" \"I'm sailing away my own true love.\" \"Boots of Spanish Leather\"\
    \ -- Sheryl Crow just sung that. \"Roll the cotton down, aw, yeah, roll the cotton\
    \ down / Ten dollars a day is a white man's pay / Roll the cotton down/A dollar\
    \ a day is the black man's pay / Roll the cotton down.\" If you sang that song\
    \ as many times as me, you'd be writing \"I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm\
    \ no more,\" too. If you\u2019d had listened to the Robert Johnson singing, \u201C\
    Better come in my kitchen, \u2018cause it\u2019s gonna be raining out doors,\u201D\
    \ as many time as I listened to it, sometime later you just might write, \u201C\
    A Hard Rain\u2019s a-Gonna Fall.\u201D I sang a lot of \"come all you\" songs.\
    \ There's plenty of them. There's way too many to be counted. \"Come along boys\
    \ and listen to my tale / Tell you of my troubles on the old Chisholm Trail.\"\
    \ Or, \"Come all ye good people, listen while I tell / the fate of Floyd Collins,\
    \ a lad we all know well.\u201D \"Come all ye fair and tender ladies / Take warning\
    \ how you court your men / They're like a star on a summer morning / They first\
    \ appear and then they're gone again.\" And then there\u2019s this one, \"Gather\
    \ 'round, people / A story I will tell / 'Bout Pretty Boy Floyd, the outlaw /\
    \ Oklahoma knew him well.\"If you sung all these \"come all ye\" songs all the\
    \ time like I did, you'd be writing, \"Come gather 'round people where ever you\
    \ roam, admit that the waters around you have grown / Accept that soon you'll\
    \ be drenched to the bone / If your time to you is worth saving / And you better\
    \ start swimming or you'll sink like a stone / The times they are achanging.\"\
    \ You'd have written that too. There's nothing secret about it. You just do it\
    \ subliminally and unconsciously, because that's all enough, and that's all you\
    \ know. That was all that was dear to me. They were the only kinds of songs that\
    \ made sense. \"When you go down to Deep Ellum keep your money in your socks /\
    \ Women on Deep Ellum put you on the rocks.\" Sing that song for a while and you\
    \ just might come up with, \"When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter\
    \ time too / And your gravity\u2019s down and negativity don't pull you through\
    \ / Don\u2019t put on any airs / When you\u2019re down on Rue Morgue Avenue /\
    \ They got some hungry women there / And they really make a mess outta you.\"\
    \ All these songs are connected. Don't be fooled. I just opened up a different\
    \ door in a different kind of way. It's just different, saying the same thing.\
    \ I didn't think it was anything out of the ordinary. Well you know, I just thought\
    \ I was doing something natural, but right from the start, my songs were divisive\
    \ for some reason. They divided people. I never knew why. Some got angered, others\
    \ loved them. Didn't know why my songs had detractors and supporters. A strange\
    \ environment to have to throw your songs into, but I did it anyway. Last thing\
    \ I thought of was who cared about what song I was writing. I was just writing\
    \ them. I didn't think I was doing anything different. I thought I was just extending\
    \ the line. Maybe a little bit unruly, but I was just elaborating on situations.\
    \ Maybe hard to pin down, but so what? A lot of people are hard to pin down and\
    \ you\u2019ve just got to bear it. In a sense everything evened itself out. Leiber\
    \ and Stoller didn\u2019t think much of my songs. They didn't like 'em, but Doc\
    \ Pomus did. That was all right that they didn't like 'em, because I never liked\
    \ their songs either. \"Yakety yak, don't talk back.\" \"Charlie Brown is a clown,\"\
    \ \"Baby I'm a hog for you.\" Novelty songs, not serious. Doc's songs, they were\
    \ better. \"This Magic Moment.\" \"Lonely Avenue.\" \u201CSave the Last Dance\
    \ for Me.\u201D Those songs broke my heart. I figured I'd rather have his blessings\
    \ any day than theirs. Ahmet Ertegun didn't think much of my songs, but Sam Phillips\
    \ did. Ahmet founded Atlantic Records. He produced some great records: Ray Charles,\
    \ Ruth Brown, LaVerne Baker, just to name a few. There were some great records\
    \ in there, no doubt about it. But Sam Phillips, he recorded Elvis and Jerry Lee,\
    \ Carl Perkins and Johnny Cash. Radical artists that shook the very essence of\
    \ humanity. Revolutionaries with vision and foresight. Fearless and sensitive\
    \ at the same time. Revolution in style and scope. Radical to the bone. Songs\
    \ that cut you to the bone. Renegades in all degrees, doing songs that would never\
    \ decay, and still resound to this day. Oh, yeah, I'd rather have Sam Phillips'\
    \ blessing any day. Merle Haggard didn't think much of my songs, but Buck Owens\
    \ did, and Buck even recorded some of my early songs. Now I admire Merle -- \"\
    Mama Tried,\" \"Tonight The Bottle Let Me Down,\" \"I'm a Lonesome Fugitive.\"\
    \ I understand all that but I can't imagine Waylon Jennings singing \"The Bottle\
    \ Let Me Down.\" I love Merle but he\u2019s not Buck. Buck Owens wrote \"Together\
    \ Again\" and that song trumps anything that ever came out of Bakersfield. Buck\
    \ Owens and Merle Haggard? If you have to have somebody's blessing -- you figure\
    \ it out. What I\u2019m saying here is that my songs seem to divide people. Even\
    \ people in the music community. People in the critical world too. Critics have\
    \ always been on my tail since day one. Seems like they\u2019ve always given me\
    \ special treatment. Some of the music critics say I can't sing. I croak. Sound\
    \ like a frog. Why don't these same critics say similar things about Tom Waits?\
    \ They say my voice is shot. That I have no voice. Why don't they say those things\
    \ about Leonard Cohen? Why do I get special treatment? Critics say I can't carry\
    \ a tune and I talk my way through a song. Really? I've never heard that said\
    \ about Lou Reed. Why does he get to go scot-free? What have I done to deserve\
    \ this special treatment? Why me lord? No vocal range? When's the last time you\u2019\
    ve read that about Dr. John? You\u2019ve never read that about Dr John. Why don't\
    \ they say that about him? Slur my words, got no diction. You have to wonder if\
    \ these critics have ever heard Charley Patton or Son House or Wolf. Talk about\
    \ slurred words and no diction. Why don\u2019t they say those same things about\
    \ them. \"Why me, Lord?\" Critics say I mangle my melodies, render my songs unrecognizable.\
    \ Oh, really? Let me tell you something. I was at a boxing match a few years ago\
    \ seeing Floyd Mayweather fight a Puerto Rican guy. And the Puerto Rican national\
    \ anthem, somebody sang it and it was beautiful. It was heartfelt and it was moving.\
    \ After that it was time for our national anthem. And a very popular soul-singing\
    \ sister was chosen to sing. She sang every note - - that exists, and some that\
    \ don't exist. Talk about mangling a melody. You take a onesyllable word and make\
    \ it last for 15 minutes? She was doing vocal gymnastics like she was a trapeze\
    \ act. But to me it was not funny.Where were the critics? Mangling lyrics? Mangling\
    \ a melody? Mangling a treasured song? No, I get the blame. But I don't really\
    \ think I do that. I just think critics say I do. Sam Cooke said this when told\
    \ he had a beautiful voice: He said, \"Well that's very kind of you, but voices\
    \ ought not to be measured by how pretty they are. Instead they matter only if\
    \ they convince you that they are telling the truth.\" Think about that the next\
    \ time you are listening to a singer. Times always change. They really do. And\
    \ you have to always be ready for something that's coming along and you never\
    \ expected it. Way back when, I was in Nashville making some records and I read\
    \ this article, a Tom T. Hall interview. Tom T. Hall, he was bitching about some\
    \ kind of new song, and he couldn't understand what these new kinds of songs that\
    \ were coming in were about. Now Tom, he was one of the most preeminent songwriters\
    \ of the time in Nashville. A lot of people were recording his songs and he himself\
    \ even did it. But he was all in a fuss about James Taylor, a song James had called\
    \ \"Country Road.\" Tom was going off in this interview -- \"But James don't say\
    \ nothing about a country road. He's just says how you can feel it on the country\
    \ road. I don't understand that.\" Now some might say Tom is a great songwriter.\
    \ I'm not going to doubt that. At the time he was doing this interview I was actually\
    \ listening to a song of his on the radio. It was called \"I Love.\" I was listening\
    \ to it in a recording studio, and he was talking about all the things he loves,\
    \ an everyman kind of song, trying to connect with people. Trying to make you\
    \ think that he's just like you and you're just like him. We all love the same\
    \ things, and we're all in this together. Tom loves little baby ducks, slow-moving\
    \ trains and rain. He loves old pickup trucks and little country streams. Sleep\
    \ without dreams. Bourbon in a glass. Coffee in a cup. Tomatoes on the vine, and\
    \ onions. Now listen, I'm not ever going to disparage another songwriter. I'm\
    \ not going to do that. I'm not saying it's a bad song. I'm just saying it might\
    \ be a little overcooked. But, you know, it was in the top 10 anyway. Tom and\
    \ a few other writers had the whole Nashville scene sewed up in a box. If you\
    \ wanted to record a song and get it in the top 10 you had to go to them, and\
    \ Tom was one of the top guys. They were all very comfortable, doing their thing.\
    \ This was about the time that Willie Nelson picked up and moved to Texas. About\
    \ the same time. He's still in Texas. Everything was very copacetic. Everything\
    \ was all right until -- until -- Kristofferson came to town. Oh, they ain't seen\
    \ anybody like him. He came into town like a wildcat that he was, flew a helicopter\
    \ into Johnny Cash'sbackyard, not your typical songwriter. And he went for the\
    \ throat. \"Sunday Morning Coming Down.\" Well, I woke up Sunday morning With\
    \ no way to hold my head that didn't hurt. And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't\
    \ bad So I had one more for dessert Then I fumbled through my closet Found my\
    \ cleanest dirty shirt Then I washed my face and combed my hair And stumbled down\
    \ the stairs to meet the day. You can look at Nashville pre-Kris and post-Kris,\
    \ because he changed everything. That one song blew ol\u2019 Tom T. Hall's world\
    \ apart. He couldn\u2019t see it coming. It might have sent him to the mad house.\
    \ God forbid he ever heard any of my songs. You walk into the room With your pencil\
    \ in your hand You see somebody naked You say, \u201CWho is that man?\u201D You\
    \ try so hard But you don\u2019t understand Just what you're gonna say When you\
    \ get home But you don\u2019t know what it is Do you, Mister Jones? If \"Sunday\
    \ Morning Coming Down\" rattled Tom's cage, sent him into the loony bin, my song\
    \ surely would have made him blow his brains out, right there in the loony bin.\
    \ Hopefully he didn't hear it.I just released an album of standards, all the songs\
    \ usually done by Michael Buble, Harry Connick Jr., maybe Brian Wilson's done\
    \ a couple, Linda Ronstadt done 'em. Rod of course, even Paul has done some of\
    \ this kind of material. But the reviews of their records aren\u2019t like mine.\
    \ In their reviews no one says anything. In my reviews, they've got to look under\
    \ every stone and report about it. In the review they get, you seldom see any\
    \ of the songwriters names. Unlike mine. They've got to mention all the songwriters'\
    \ names. Well that's OK with me. After all, they're great songwriters and these\
    \ are standards. I've seen the reviews come in, and they'll mention all the songwriters\
    \ in half the review, as if everybody knows them. Nobody's heard of them, not\
    \ in this time, anyway. Buddy Kaye, Cy Coleman, Carolyn Leigh, to name a few.\
    \ But, you know, I'm glad they mention their names, and you know what? I'm glad\
    \ they got their names in the press. It might have taken some time to do it, but\
    \ they're finally there with importance and dignity. I can only wonder why it\
    \ took so long. My only regret is that they're not here to see it. Traditional\
    \ rock 'n' roll, we're talking about that. It's all about rhythm. Johnny Cash\
    \ said it best: \"Get rhythm. Get rhythm when you get the blues.\" Very few rock\
    \ 'n' roll bands today play with rhythm. They don't know what it is. Rock 'n'\
    \ roll is a combination of blues, and it's a strange thing made up of two parts.\
    \ A lot of people don't know this, but the blues, which is an American music,\
    \ is not what you think it is. It's a combination of Arabic violins and Strauss\
    \ waltzes working it out. But it's true. The other half of rock 'n' roll has got\
    \ to be hillbilly. And that's a derogatory term, but it ought not to be. That's\
    \ a term that includes the Delmore Bros., Stanley Bros., Roscoe Holcomb, Git Tanner\
    \ and the Skillet Lickers ... groups like that. Moonshine gone berserk. Fast cars\
    \ on dirt roads. That's the kind of combination that makes up rock 'n' roll, and\
    \ it can't be cooked up in a science laboratory or a studio. You have to have\
    \ the right kind of rhythm to play this kind of music. If you can't hardly play\
    \ the blues, and you don\u2019t have the hillbilly feeling, you\u2019re not really\
    \ playing Rock n Roll. It might be something else but it\u2019s not that. You\
    \ can fake it, but you can't make it. Critics have said that I\u2019ve made a\
    \ career out of confounding expectations. Really? Because that's all I do? That's\
    \ how I think about it. Confounding expectations. Like I stay up late at night\
    \ thinking about how to do it. \"What do you do for a living, man?\" \"Oh, I confound\
    \ expectations.\" You're going to get a job, the man says, \"What do you do?\"\
    \ \"Oh, confound expectations.: And the man says, \"Well, we already have that\
    \ spot filled. Call us back. Or don't call us, we'll call you.\" Confounding expectations.\
    \ I don\u2019t even know what that means or who has time for it.\u2018Why me,\
    \ Lord? My work confounds them obviously, but I really don't know how I do it.\
    \ The Blackwood Bros. have been talking to me about making a record together.\
    \ That might confound expectations, but it shouldn't. Of course it would be a\
    \ gospel album. I don't think it would be anything out of the ordinary for me.\
    \ Not a bit. One of the songs I'm thinking about singing is \"Stand By Me\" with\
    \ the Blackwood Brothers. Not \"Stand By Me\" the pop song. No. The real \"Stand\
    \ By Me.\" The real one goes like this: When the storm of life is raging / Stand\
    \ by me / When the storm of life is raging / Stand by me / When the world is tossing\
    \ me / Like a ship upon the sea / Thou who rulest wind and water / Stand by me\
    \ In the midst of tribulation / Stand by me / In the midst of tribulation / Stand\
    \ by me / When the hosts of hell assail / And my strength begins to fail / Thou\
    \ whomever lost a battle / Stand by me In the midst of faults and failures / Stand\
    \ by me / In the midst of faults and failures / Stand by me / When I do the best\
    \ I can / And my friends don't understand/ Thou who knowest all about me / Stand\
    \ by me That's the song. I like it better than the pop song. If I record one by\
    \ that name, that's going to be the one. I'm also thinking of recording a song,\
    \ not for that album, though \u2013 a song called \"Oh Lord, Please Don't Let\
    \ Me Be Misunderstood.\" But I don\u2019t know, it might be good on the gospel\
    \ album too. Anyway, I'm proud to be here tonight for MusiCares. I'm honored to\
    \ have all these artists singing my songs. There's nothing like that. Great artists.\
    \ Who all know how to sing the truth, and you can hear it in their voices. I'm\
    \ proud to be here tonight for MusiCares. I think a lot of this organization.\
    \ They've helped many people. Many musicians who have contributed a lot to our\
    \ culture. I'd like to personally thank them for what they did for a friend of\
    \ mine, Billy Lee Riley. A friend of mine who they helped for six years when he\
    \ was down and couldn't work. Billy was a Sun rock 'n' roll artist. He was a true\
    \ original. He did it all; played, sang and wrote. He would have been a bigger\
    \ star but Jerry Lee came along. And you know what happens when someone like that\
    \ comes along. You kind of have to take a step back. You just don't stand a chance.\
    \ So Billy became what is known in the industry -- a condescending term, by the\
    \ way -- as a one-hit wonder. But sometimes, just sometimes, once in a while,\
    \ a one hit wonder can make a more powerful impact than a recording star who's\
    \ got 20 or 30 hits behind him. And Billy's hit song was called \"Red Hot,\" and\
    \ it was red hot. It could blast you out of your skull and make you feel happy\
    \ about it. Change your life. He did it with power and style and grace. You won't\
    \ find him in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He's not there. Metallica is. Abba\
    \ is. Mamas and the Papas -- I know they're in there. Jefferson Airplane, Alice\
    \ Cooper, Steely Dan -- I've got nothing against Metal, Soft Rock, Hard Rock,\
    \ Psychedelic Pop. I got nothing against any of that stuff. But after all, it\
    \ is called the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Billy Lee Riley is not there. Yet.\
    \ And it\u2019s taking too long. I'd see him a couple times a year and we'd always\
    \ spent time together and he was on a rockabilly festival nostalgia circuit, and\
    \ we'd cross paths now and again. We'd always spend time together. He was a hero\
    \ of mine. I'd heard \"Red Hot.\" I must have been only 15 or 16 when I did and\
    \ it's impressed me to this day. I never grow tired of listening to it. Never\
    \ got tired of watching Billy Lee perform, either. We spent time together just\
    \ talking and playing into the night. He was a deep, truthful man. He wasn't bitter\
    \ or nostalgic. He just accepted it. He knew where he had come from and he was\
    \ content with who he was. And then one day he got sick. And like my friend John\
    \ Mellencamp would sing -- because John sang some truth today -- one day you get\
    \ sick and you don't get better. That's from a song of his called \"Life is Short\
    \ Even on Its Longest Days.\" It's one of the better songs of the last few years,\
    \ actually. I ain't lying. And I ain't lying when I tell you that MusiCares paid\
    \ for my friend's doctor bills, mortgage and gave him spending money. They were\
    \ able to at least make his life comfortable, tolerable to the end. That is something\
    \ that can't be repaid. Any organization that would do that would have to have\
    \ my blessing. I'm going to get out of here now. I'm going to put an egg in my\
    \ shoe and beat it. I probably left out a lot of people and said too much about\
    \ some. But that's OK. Like the spiritual song, 'I'm still just crossing over\
    \ Jordan too.' Let's hope we meet again. Sometime. And we will, if, like Hank\
    \ Williams says, \"the good Lord willing and the creek don't rise.\u201DSee Bob\

  Grand Coulee Dam: 'Well, the world owns seven wonders as the travellers always tell

    Some gardens and some towers, I guess you know them well

    But now the greatest wonder is in Uncle Sam''s fair land

    That King Columbia river and the great Grand Coulee Dam


    She come up the Canadian Rockies where the crystal waters glide

    Comes a-roaring down the canyon to meet that salty tide

    From the great Pacific Ocean to where the sun sets in the west

    That big Grand Coulee country in that land I love the best


    In the misty glitter of that wild and windward spray

    Men have fought the pounding waters and met a watery grave

    Once she tore men''s boats to splinters but she gave men dreams to dream

    That day that Grand Coulee dam went across that wild and restless stream


    Oh, Uncle Sam took up the notion in the year of thirty three

    For the factory and the farmer and for all of you and me

    He said: roll it on Columbia, you can roll out to the sea

    But river, while you''re rolling you can do some work for me


    Now from Washington and Oregon you can hear them factories a-hum

    Making corn and making manganese and light aluminum

    Always a flying fortress to blast for Uncle Sam

  Green, Green Grass of Home (Infidels Outtake): '[Verse 1]

    The old hometown looks the same

    As I step down from the train

    And there to meet me is my mama and papa

    Down the road I look and there runs Mary

    Hair of gold and lips like cherries

    The old house is still standing

    Though the paint is cracked and dry

    And there''s that old oak tree that I used to play on

    Down the road, I walk with my sweet Mary

    Hair of gold and lips like cherries

    It''s good to touch the green, green grass of home


    [Instrumental Break]


    [Verse 3]

    Then I awake and look around me

    At four grey walls that surround me

    And I realize, yes, I was only dreaming

    She said, "Take it off the shelf

    As great as you are, man

    You''ll never be greater than yourself."

    I told her I didn''t really care

    I''m getting'' up in the morning

    I believe I''ll dust my broom

    Keeping away from the women

    I''m givin'' ''em lots of room

  Highlands: '[Verse 1]

    Well, my heart''s in the Highlands gentle and fair

    Honeysuckle bloomin'' in the Wildwood air

    Bluebells blazin'' where the Aberdeen waters flow

    Well my heart''s in the Highlands

    I''m gonna go there when I feel good enough to go


    [Verse 2]

    Windows was shakin'' all night in my dreams

    Everything was exactly the way that it seems

    Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page

    Same ol'' rat race

    Life in the same ol'' cage


    [Verse 3]

    I don''t want nothin'' from anyone, ain''t that much to take

    Wouldn''t know the difference between a real blonde and a fake

    Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery

    I wish someone would come

    And push back the clock for me


    [Verse 4]

    Well my heart''s in the Highlands wherever I roam

    That''s where I''ll be when I get called home

    The wind, it whispers to the buckeyed trees in rhyme

    Well my heart''s in the Highlands

    I can only get there one step at a time

    Someone''s always yellin'' turn it down

    Feel like I''m drifting

    Drifting from scene to scene

    I''m wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean?


    [Verse 6]

    Insanity is smashin'' up against my soul

    You could say I was on anything but a roll

    If I had a conscience, well, I just might blow my top

    What would I do with it anyway?

    Maybe take it to the pawn shop


    [Verse 7]

    My heart''s in the Highlands at the break of dawn

    By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan

    Big white clouds like chariots that swing down low

    Well my heart''s in the Highlands

    Only place left to go


    [Verse 8]

    I''m in Boston town, in some restaurant

    I got no idea what I want

    Or maybe I do but I''m just really not sure

    Waitress comes over

    Nobody in the place but me and her

    [Verse 9]

    Well, it must be a holiday, there''s nobody around

    She studies me closely as I sit down

    She got a pretty face and long white shiny legs

    I said "Tell me what I want"

    She say, "You probably want hard boiled eggs"


    [Verse 10]

    I say "That''s right: bring me some"

    She says "We ain''t got any, you picked the wrong time to come"

    Then she says, "I know you''re an artist, draw a picture of me"

    I said, "I would if I could, but

    I don''t do sketches from memory"


    [Verse 11]

    "Well," she says, "I''m right here in front of you, or haven''t you looked?"

    I say, "All right, I know, but I don''t have my drawing book"

    She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that"

    I say, "Yes I could, but

    I don''t know where my pencil is at"


    [Verse 12]

    She pulls one out from behind her ear

    She says, "All right now, go ahead, draw me, I''m standing right here"

    I make a few lines and I show it for her to see

    Well she takes the napkin and throws it back

    And says, "That don''t look a thing like me"

    [Verse 13]

    I said, "Oh, kind Miss, it most certainly does"

    She says, "You must be jokin''," I say, "I wish I was"

    Then she says, "You don''t read women authors, do you?"

    At least that''s what I think I hear her say

    "Well," I say, "how would you know? And what would it matter anyway?"


    [Verse 14]

    "Well," she says, "You just don''t seem like you do"

    I said, "You''re way wrong"

    She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I read Erica Jong!"

    She goes away for a minute

    And I slide up out of my chair

    I step outside back to the busy street but nobody''s going anywhere


    [Verse 15]

    Well, my heart''s in the Highlands with the horses and hounds

    Way up in the border country, far from the towns

    With the twang of the arrow and a snap of the bow

    My heart''s in the Highlands

    Can''t see any other way to go


    [Verse 16]

    Every day is the same thing out the door

    Feel further away than ever before

    Some things in life, it gets too late to learn

    Well, I''m lost somewhere

    I must have made a few bad turns


    [Verse 17]

    I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes

    They''re drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes

    All the young men with their young women looking so good

    Well, I''d trade places with any of them

    In a minute, if I could


    [Verse 18]

    I''m crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog

    Talking to myself in a monologue

    I think what I need might be a full-length leather coat

    Somebody just asked me

    If I registered to vote


    [Verse 19]

    The sun is beginning to shine on me

    But it''s not like the sun that used to be

    The party''s over and there''s less and less to say

    I got new eyes

    Everything looks far away


    [Verse 20]

    Well, my heart''s in the Highlands at the break of day

    Over the hills and far away

    There''s a way to get there and I''ll figure it out somehow

    But I''m already there in my mind

    And that''s good enough for now3'

  Hurricane (cut): 'Pistol shots ring out in the barroom night

    Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall

    She sees the bartender in a pool of blood

    Cries out, "My God, they''ve killed them all!"

    Here comes the story of the Hurricane

    The man the authorities came to blame

    For somethin'' that he never done

    Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been

    The champion of the world


    Three bodies lyin'' there does Patty see

    And another man named Bello, movin'' around mysteriously

    "I didn''t do it," he says, and he throws up his hands

    "I was only robbin'' the register, I hope you understand

    I saw them leavin''," he says, and he stops

    "One of us had better call up the cops."

    And so Patty calls the cops

    And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashin''

    In the hot New Jersey night


    Meanwhile, far away in another part of town

    Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin'' around

    Number one contender for the middleweight crown

    Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down

    When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road

    Just like the time before and the time before that

    In Paterson that''s just the way things go

    If you''re black you might as well not show up on the street

    Eclipses both the sun and moon

    There is no sense in trying

    Suicide remarks are torn

    Plays wasted words, proves to warn

    Is busy dying

    While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing

    Distant ships sailing into the mist

    You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing

    Freedom just around the corner for you

    But with the truth so far off, what good will it do?


    [Chorus]

    Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune

    Bird fly high by the light of the moon

    Oh, oh-oh Jokerman


    [Verse 2]

    So swiftly the sun sets in the sky

    You rise up and say goodbye to no one

    No store bought shirt for you on your back

    One of the women must sit in the shack and sew one

    Shedding off one more layer of skin

    Keeping one step ahead of the persecutor within


    [Chorus]

    You''re a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds

    Manipulator of crowds, you''re a dream twister

    You''re going to Sodom and Gomorrah, but what do you care?

    Ain''t nobody there would want to marry your sister

    Scratching the world with a fine-toothed comb

    You''re a king among nations, you''re a stranger at home


    [Chorus]

    Bird fly high by the light of the moon

    Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman


    [Verse 4]

    Now, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy

    The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers

    No crystal ball do you need on your shelf

    Michelangelo himself, could''ve carved out your features

    So drunk, standing in the middle of the street

    Directing traffic with a small dog licking your feet


    [Chorus]

    Bird fly high by the light of the moon

    Oh, oh-oh Jokerman

    [Verse 5]

    Well, the preacher man talking about the deaf and the dumb

    And a world to come, thats already been pre-determined

    Nightsticks and water cannons, tear gas, and padlocks

    Molotov cocktails and rocks can''t drown out his sermon

    You let the wicked walk right into a trap

    You give away all the good things that fall in your lap


    [Chorus]

    Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune

    Bird fly high by the light of the moon

    Oh, oh-oh Jokerman


    [Verse 6]

    It''s a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray

    A woman just give birth to a prince today and she''s dressed in scarlet

    He''ll turn priests into pimps and make old men bark

    Take a woman who could have been Joan-of-Arc and turn her into a harlot

    Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants

    Oh, Jokerman, you don''t show any response

  Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie: '[Intro]

    I have a poem here. It''s not a poem, it''s... This is the first concert I played
    alone in New York, really. An a fellow in Brooklyn State Hospital, his name is
    Woody Guthrie. But Woody is more than a folk singer. He''s really something else
    more than a folk singer and there''s this book coming out that''s dedicated to
    him. And they asked me to write something about Woody, like what does Woody mean
    to you in 25 words. And I couldn''t do it, I wrote out 5 pages and I have it here.
    I have it here by accident actually. But I''d like to say this out loud. So this
    is my feelings towards Woody Guthrie. Cannot really be told in how many records
    of his I buy, it''s a lot more than that actually. So if you can roll along with
    this thing here this is called "Last Thoughts On Woody Guthrie"


    [Verse 1]

    When yer head gets twisted and yer mind grows numb

    When you think you''re too old, too young, too smart or too dumb

    When yer laggin'' behind an'' losing yer pace

    In a slow-motion crawl of life''s busy race

    No matter what yer doing if you start givin'' up

    If the wine don''t come to the top of yer cup

    If the wind''s got you sideways with one hand holdin'' on

    And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone

    And yer train engine fire needs a new spark to catch it

    And the wood''s easy findin'' but yer lazy to fetch it

    And yer sidewalk starts curlin'' and the street gets too long

    And you start walkin'' backwards though you know its wrong

    And lonesome comes up as down goes the day

    And tomorrow''s morning seems so far away

    And you feel the reins from yer pony are slippin''

    And yer rope is a-slidin'' cause yer hands are a-drippin''

    And yer sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys

    Turn to broken down slums and trash-can alleys

    And yer sky cries water and yer drain pipe''s a-pourin''

    And the lightnin''s a-flashing and the thunder''s a-crashin''

    And the windows are rattlin'' and breakin'' and the roof tops a-shakin''

    And yer whole world''s a-slamming  and banging

    And yer minutes of sun turn to hours of storm

    And to yourself you sometimes say

    "I never knew it was gonna be this way

    Why didn''t they tell me the day I was born"

    And you start gettin'' chills and yer jumping from sweat

    And you''re looking for something you ain''t quite found yet

    And yer knee-deep in the dark water with yer hands in the air

    And the whole world''s a-watching with a window peek stare

    And yer good gal leaves and she''s long gone a-flying

    And yer heart feels sick like fish when they''re frying

    And yer jackhammer falls from yer hand to yer feet

    And you need it badly but it lays on the street

    And yer bell''s bangin'' loudly but you can''t hear its beat

    And you think yer ears might a been hurt

    Or yer eyes''ve turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt

    And you figured you failed in yesterdays rush

    When you were faked out an'' fooled while facing a four flush

    And all the time you were holdin'' three queens

    And it''s making you mad, it''s makin'' you mean

    Like in the middle of Life magazine

    Bouncin'' around a pinball machine

    And there''s something on yer mind you wanna be saying

    That somebody someplace oughta be hearin''

    But it''s trapped on yer tongue and sealed in yer head

    And it bothers you badly when you''re laying in bed

    And no matter how you try you just can''t say it

    And yer scared to yer soul you just might forget it

    And yer eyes get swimmy from the tears in yer head

    And yer pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead

    And the lion''s mouth opens and yer staring at his teeth

    And his jaws start closing with you underneath

    And yer flat on your belly with yer hands tied behind

    And you wish you''d never taken that last detour sign

    And you say to yourself just what am I doing

    On this road I''m walkin'', on this trail I''m turnin''

    On this curve I''m hanging

    On this pathway I''m strolling, in the space I''m taking

    In this air I''m inhaling

    Am I mixed up too much, am I mixed up too hard

    Why am I walking, where am I running

    What am I saying, what am I knowing

    On this guitar I''m playing, on this banjo I''m frailin''

    On this mandolin I''m strumming, in the song I''m singin''

    In the tune I''m humming, in the words I''m writin''

    In the words that I''m thinking

    In this ocean of hours I''m all the time drinkin''

    Who am I helping, what am I breaking

    What am I giving, what am I taking

    But you try with your whole soul best

    Never to think these thoughts and never to let

    Them kind of thoughts gain ground

    Or make yer heart pound

    But then again you know when they''re around

    Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down

    ''Cause sometimes you hear''em when the night times comes creeping

    And you fear that they might catch you a-sleeping

    And you jump from yer bed, from yer last chapter of dreamin''

    And you can''t remember for the best of yer thinking

    If that was you in the dream that was screaming

    And you know that it''s something special you''re needin''

    And you know that there''s no drug that''ll do for the healin''

    And no liquor in the land to stop yer brain from bleeding

    And you need something special

    Yeah, you need something special all right

    You need a fast flying train on a tornado track

    To shoot you someplace and shoot you back

    You need a cyclone wind on a stream engine howler

    That''s been banging and booming and blowing forever

    That knows yer troubles a hundred times over

    You need a Greyhound bus that don''t bar no race

    That won''t laugh at yer looks

    Your voice or your face

    And by any number of bets in the book

    Will be rolling long after the bubblegum craze

    You need something to open up a new door

    To show you something you seen before

    But overlooked a hundred times or more

    You need something to open your eyes

    You need something to make it known

    That it''s you and no one else that owns

    That spot that yer standing, that space that you''re sitting

    That the world ain''t got you beat

    That it ain''t got you licked

    It can''t get you crazy no matter how many

    Times you might get kicked

    You need something special all right

    You need something special to give you hope

    But hope''s just a word

    That maybe you said or maybe you heard

    On some windy corner ''round a wide-angled curve

    See Bob Dylan LiveGet tickets as low as $57[Bridge]

    But that''s what you need man, and you need it bad

    And yer trouble is you know it too good

    ''Cause you look an'' you start getting the chills


    [Verse 2]

    ''Cause you can''t find it on a dollar bill

    And it ain''t on Macy''s window sill

    And it ain''t on no rich kid''s road map

    And it ain''t in no fat kid''s fraternity house

    And it ain''t made in no Hollywood wheat germ

    And it ain''t on that dimlit stage

    With that half-wit comedian on it

    Ranting and raving and taking yer money

    And you think it''s funny

    No you can''t find it in no night club or no yacht club

    And it ain''t in the seats of a supper club

    And sure as hell you''re bound to tell

    That no matter how hard you rub

    You just ain''t a-gonna find it on yer ticket stub

    No, and it ain''t in the rumors people''re tellin'' you

    And it ain''t in the pimple-lotion people are sellin'' you

    And it ain''t in no cardboard-box house

    Or down any movie star''s blouse

    And you can''t find it on the golf course

    And Uncle Remus can''t tell you and neither can Santa Claus

    And it ain''t in the cream puff hair-do or cotton candy clothes

    And it ain''t in the dime store dummies or bubblegum goons

    And it ain''t in the marshmallow noises of the chocolate cake voices

    That come knockin'' and tappin'' in Christmas wrappin''

    Sayin'' ain''t I pretty and ain''t I cute and look at my skin

    Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow

    Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry

    When you can''t even sense if they got any insides

    These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows

    No you''ll not now or no other day

    Find it on the doorsteps made out-a paper mache

    And inside it the people made of molasses

    That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses

    And it ain''t in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies

    Who''d turn yuh in for a tenth of a penny

    Who breathe and burp and bend and crack

    And before you can count from one to ten

    Do it all over again but this time behind yer back

    My friend

    The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl

    And play games with each other in their sand-box world

    And you can''t find it either in the no-talent fools

    That run around gallant

    And make all rules for the ones that got talent

    And it ain''t in the ones that ain''t got any talent but think they do

    And think they''re foolin'' you

    The ones who jump on the wagon

    Just for a while cause they know it''s in style

    To get their kicks, get out of it quick

    And make all kinds of money and chicks

    And you yell to yourself and you throw down yer hat

    Sayin'', "Christ do I gotta be like that

    Ain''t there no one here that knows where I''m at

    Ain''t there no one here that knows how I feel

    Good God Almighty

    THAT STUFF AIN''T REAL"

    No but that ain''t yer game, it ain''t yer race

    You can''t hear yer name, you can''t see yer face

    You gotta look some other place

    And where do you look for this hope that yer seekin''

    Where do you look for this lamp that''s a-burnin''

    Where do you look for this oil well gushin''

    Where do you look for this candle that''s glowin''

    Where do you look for this hope that you know is there

    And out there somewhere

    And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads

    Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows

    Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways

    You can touch and twist

    And turn two kinds of doorknobs

    You can either go to the church of your choice

    Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital

    You''ll find God in the church of your choice

    You''ll find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital


    [Outro]

    And though it''s only my opinion

    I may be right or wrong

    You''ll find them both

    In the Grand Canyon

    The last of leaves fell from the trees

    And clung to a new love''s breast

    The branches bare like a banjo played

    To the winds that listened best

    Lay down the song you strum

  Life Is Hard: '[Verse 1]

    The evening winds are still

    I''ve lost the way and will

    Can''t tell you where they went

    I just know what they meant

    I''m always on my guard

    Admitting life is hard

    Without you near me


    [Verse 2]

    The friend you used to be

    So near and dear to me

    You slipped so far away

    Where did we go a-stray

    I pass the old schoolyard

    Admitting life is hard

    Without you near me


    [Verse 3]

    Ever since the day

    The day you went away

    I felt that emptiness so wide

    I don''t know what''s wrong or right

    I just know I need strength to fight

    Strength to fight that world outside

    Since we''ve been out of touch

    I haven''t felt that much

    From day to barren day

    My heart stays locked away

    I walk the boulevard

    Admitting life is hard

    Without you near me


    [Verse 5]

    The sun is sinking low

    I guess it''s time to go

    I feel a chilly breeze

    In place of memories

    My dreams are locked and barred

    Admitting life is hard

    Without you near me1'

  Lily of the West: '[Verse 1]

    When first I came to Louisville, some pleasure there to find

    A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind

    Her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips, like arrows pierced my breast

    And the name she bore was Flora, the lily of the west


    [Verse 2]

    I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find

    But she turned unto another man whose sore distressed my mind

    She robbed me of my liberty, deprived me of my rest

    Then go, my lovely Flora, the lily of the west


    [Verse 3]

    Away down in yonder shady grove, a man of high degree

    Conversing with my Flora there, it seemed so strange to me

    And the answer that she gave to him it sore did me oppress

    I was betrayed by Flora, the lily of the west


    [Verse 4]

    I stepped up my rival, dagger in my hand

    I seized him by the collar, and body made him stand

    Seeing mad by desperation I pierced him to the breast

    All this for lovely Flora, the lily of the west


    [Verse 5]

    I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea

    They placed me in the witness box and then commenced on me

    Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest

  Lonesome Death Of Hattie Carrol: 'William Zanzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll

    With a cane that he twirled around his diamond ring finger

    At a Baltimore hotel society gath''rin''

    And the cops were called in and his weapon took from him

    As they rode him in custody down to the station

    And booked William Zanzinger for first-degree murder

    But you who philosophize, disgrace and criticize all fears

    Take the rag away from your face, now ain''t the time for

    Your tears

    William Zanzinger, who at twenty-four years

    Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres

    With rich wealthy parents who provide and protect him

    And high office relations in the politics of Maryland

    Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders

    And swear words and sneering, and his tongue it was

    Snarling

    In a matter of minutes on bail was out walking

    But you who philosophize, disgrace and criticize all fears

    Take the rag away from your face, now ain''t the time for

    Your tears

    Hattie Carroll was a maid of the kitchen

    She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children

    Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage

    And never sat once at the head of the table

    And didn''t even talk to the people at the table

    Who just cleaned up all the food from the table

    And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level

    Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane

    That sailed through the air and came down through the room

    Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle

    And she never done nothing to William Zanzinger

    But you who philosophize, disgrace and criticize all fears

    Take the rag away from your face, now ain''t the time for

    Your tears

    In the courtroom of honor, the judge pounded his gavel

    To show that all''s equal and that the courts are on the

    Level

    And that the strings in the books ain''t pulled and

    Persuaded

    And that even the nobles get properly handled

    Once that the cops have chased after and caught ''em

    And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom

    Stared at the person who killed for no reason

    Who just happened to be feelin'' that way without warnin''

    And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished

    And handed out strongly, for penalty and repentance

    William Zanzinger with a six-month sentence

    Oh, but you who philosophize, disgrace and criticize all

    Fears

    What are you doing out there in the sun anyway?

    Don''t you know, the sun can burn your brains right out

    My enemy crashed into the dust

    Stopped dead in his tracks and he lost his lust

    That even Jesus would never

    Forgive what you do

    [Verse 7]

    Let me ask you one question

    Is your money that good?

    Will it buy you forgiveness?

    Do you think that it could?

    I think you will find

    When your death takes its toll

    All the money you made

    Will never buy back your soul

    And your death will come soon

    I will follow your casket

    And I''ll watch while you''re lowered

    Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves

    The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach

    Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow

    Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free

    Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands

    With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves

    Let me forget about today until tomorrow

  MusiCares Person of the Year Speech: "I'm glad for my songs to be honored like this.\
    \ But you know, they didn't get here by themselves. It's been a long road and\
    \ it's taken a lot of doing. These songs of mine, they're like mystery stories,\
    \ the kind that Shakespeare saw when he was growing up. I think you could trace\
    \ what I do back that far. They were on the fringes then, and I think they're\
    \ on the fringes now. And they sound like they've been on the hard ground\n\n\
    I should mention a few people along the way who brought this about. I know I should\
    \ mention John Hammond, great talent scout for Columbia Records. He signed me\
    \ to that label when I was nobody. It took a lot of faith to do that, and he took\
    \ a lot of ridicule, but he was his own man and he was courageous. And for that,\
    \ I'm eternally grateful. The last person he discovered before me was Aretha Franklin,\
    \ and before that Count Basie, Billie Holiday and a whole lot of other artists.\
    \ All noncommercial artists\n\nTrends did not interest John, and I was very noncommercial\
    \ but he stayed with me. He believed in my talent and that's all that mattered.\
    \ I can't thank him enough for that\n\nLou Levy runs Leeds Music, and they published\
    \ my earliest songs, but I didn't stay there too long. Levy himself, he went back\
    \ a long ways. He signed me to that company and recorded my songs and I sang them\
    \ into a tape recorder. He told me outright, there was no precedent for what I\
    \ was doing, that I was either before my time or behind it. And if I brought him\
    \ a song like \"Stardust,\" he'd turn it down because it would be too late\n\n\
    He told me that if I was before my time -- and he didn't really know that for\
    \ sure -- but if it was happening and if it was true, the public would usually\
    \ take three to five years to catch up -- so be prepared. And that did happen.\
    \ The trouble was, when the public did catch up I was already three to five years\
    \ beyond that, so it kind of complicated it. But he was encouraging, and he didn't\
    \ judge me, and I'll always remember him for that\n\nArtie Mogull at Witmark Music\
    \ signed me next to his company, and he told me to just keep writing songs no\
    \ matter what, that I might be on to something. Well, he too stood behind me,\
    \ and he could never wait to see what I'd give him next. I didn't even think of\
    \ myself as a songwriter before then. I'll always be grateful for him also for\
    \ that attitude\n\nI also have to mention some of the early artists who recorded\
    \ my songs very, very early, without having to be asked. Just something they felt\
    \ about them that was right for them. I've got to say thank you to Peter, Paul\
    \ and Mary, who I knew all separately before they ever became a group. I didn't\
    \ even think of myself as writing songs for others to sing but it was starting\
    \ to happen and it couldn't have happened to, or with, a better group\n\nThey\
    \ took a song of mine that had been recorded before that was buried on one of\
    \ my records and turned it into a hit song. Not the way I would have done it --\
    \ they straightened it out. But since then hundreds of people have recorded it\
    \ and I don't think that would have happened if it wasn't for them. They definitely\
    \ started something for me\n\nThe Byrds, the Turtles, Sonny & Cher -- they made\
    \ some of my songs Top 10 hits but I wasn't a pop songwriter and I really didn't\
    \ want to be that, but it was good that it happened. Their versions of songs were\
    \ like commercials, but I didn't really mind that because 50 years later my songs\
    \ were being used in the commercials. So that was good too. I was glad it happened,\
    \ and I was glad they'd done it\n\nPervis Staples and the Staple Singers -- long\
    \ before they were on Stax they were on Epic and they were one of my favorite\
    \ groups of all time. I met them all in '62 or '63. They heard my songs live and\
    \ Pervis wanted to record three or four of them and he did with the Staples Singers.\
    \ They were the type of artists that I wanted recording my songs\n\nNina Simone.\
    \ I used to cross paths with her in New York City in the Village Gate nightclub.\
    \ These were the artists I looked up to. She recorded some of my songs that she\
    \ [inaudible] to me. She was an overwhelming artist, piano player and singer.\
    \ Very strong woman, very outspoken. That she was recording my songs validated\
    \ everything that I was about\n\nOh, and can't forget Jimi Hendrix. I actually\
    \ saw Jimi Hendrix perform when he was in a band called Jimmy James and the Blue\
    \ Flames -- something like that. And Jimi didn't even sing. He was just the guitar\
    \ player. He took some small songs of mine that nobody paid any attention to and\
    \ pumped them up into the outer limits of the stratosphere and turned them all\
    \ into classics. I have to thank Jimi, too. I wish he was here\n\nJohnny Cash\
    \ recorded some of my songs early on, too, up in about '63, when he was all skin\
    \ and bones. He traveled long, he traveled hard, but he was a hero of mine. I\
    \ heard many of his songs growing up. I knew them better than I knew my own. \"\

    How high is the water, mama?\" Johnny was an intense character. And he saw that\
    \ people were putting me down playing electric music, and he posted letters to\
    \ magazines scolding people, telling them to shut up and let him sing\n\nIn Johnny\
    \ Cash's world -- hardcore Southern drama -- that kind of thing didn't exist.\
    \ Nobody told anybody what to sing or what not to sing. They just didn't do that\
    \ kind of thing. I'm always going to thank him for that. Johnny Cash was a giant\
    \ of a man, the man in black. And I'll always cherish the friendship we had until\
    \ the day there is no more days\n\nOh, and I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Joan\
    \ Baez. She was the queen of folk music then and now. She took a liking to my\
    \ songs and brought me with her to play concerts, where she had crowds of thousands\
    \ of people enthralled with her beauty and voice\n\nPeople would say, \"What are\
    \ you doing with that ragtag scrubby little waif?\" And she'd tell everybody in\
    \ no uncertain terms, \"Now you better be quiet and listen to the songs.\" We\
    \ even played a few of them together. Joan Baez is as tough-minded as they come.\
    \ Love. And she's a free, independent spirit. Nobody can tell her what to do if\
    \ she doesn't want to do it. I learned a lot of things from her. A woman with\
    \ devastating honesty. And for her kind of love and devotion, I could never pay\
    \ that back\n\nLRelated Rare, unusual Beatles and Rolling Stones photos surface\

    The secret Sinatra past of Bob Dylan's new album\nThese songs didn't come out\
    \ of thin air. I didn't just make them up out of whole cloth. Contrary to what\
    \ Lou Levy said, there was a precedent. It all came out of traditional music:\
    \ traditional folk music, traditional rock 'n' roll and traditional big-band swing\
    \ orchestra music\n\nI learned lyrics and how to write them from listening to\
    \ folk songs. And I played them, and I met other people that played them back\
    \ when nobody was doing it. Sang nothing but these folk songs, and they gave me\
    \ the code for everything that's fair game, that everything belongs to everyone\n\
    \nFor three or four years all I listened to were folk standards. I went to sleep\
    \ singing folk songs. I sang them everywhere, clubs, parties, bars, coffeehouses,\
    \ fields, festivals. And I met other singers along the way who did the same thing\
    \ and we just learned songs from each other. I could learn one  song and sing\
    \ it next in an hour if I'd heard it just once\n\n\nIf you sang \"John Henry\"\
    \ as many times as me -- \"John Henry was a steel-driving man / Died with a hammer\
    \ in his hand / John Henry said a man ain't nothin' but a man / Before I let that\
    \ steam drill drive me down / I'll die with that hammer in my hand.\"\nIf you\
    \ had sung that song as many times as I did, you'd have written \"How many roads\
    \ must a man walk down?\" too\n\nBig Bill Broonzy had a song called \"Key to the\
    \ Highway.\" \"I've got a key to the highway / I'm booked and I'm bound to go\
    \ / Gonna leave here runnin' because walking is most too slow.\" I sang that a\
    \ lot. If you sing that a lot, you just might write\n\nGeorgia Sam he had a bloody\
    \ nose\n\nWelfare Department they wouldn\u2019t give him no clothes\n\nHe asked\
    \ poor Howard where can I go\n\nHoward said there\u2019s only one place I know\n\
    \nSam said tell me quick man I got to run\nHoward just pointed with his gun\n\n\
    And said that way down on Highway 61\n\nYou'd have written that too if you'd sang\
    \ \"Key to the Highway\" as much as me\n\n\"Ain't no use sit 'n cry / You'll be\
    \ an angel by and by / Sail away, ladies, sail away.\" \"I'm sailing away my own\
    \ true love.\" \"Boots of Spanish Leather\" -- Sheryl Crow just sung that\n\n\"\
    Roll the cotton down, aw, yeah, roll the cotton down / Ten dollars a day is a\
    \ white man's pay / A dollar a day is the black man's pay / Roll the cotton down.\"\
    \ If you sang that song as many times as me, you'd be writing \"I ain't gonna\
    \ work on Maggie's farm no more,\" too\nI sang a lot of \"come all you\" songs.\
    \ There's plenty of them. There's way too  many to be counted. \"Come along boys\
    \ and listen to my tale / Tell you of my trouble on the old Chisholm Trail.\"\
    \ Or, \"Come all ye good people, listen while I tell / the fate of Floyd Collins\
    \ a lad we all know well / The fate of Floyd Collins, a lad we all know well.\"\
    \n\n\"Come all ye fair and tender ladies / Take warning how you court your men\
    \ / They're like a star on a summer morning / They first appear and then they're\
    \ gone again.\" \"If you'll gather 'round, people / A story I will tell /  'Bout\
    \ Pretty Boy Floyd, an outlaw / Oklahoma knew him well.\"\nIf you sung all these\
    \ \"come all ye\" songs all the time, you'd be writing, \"Come gather 'round people\
    \ where ever you roam, admit that the waters around you have grown / Accept that\
    \ soon you'll be drenched to the bone / If your time to you is worth saving /\
    \ And you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone / The times they are\
    \ a-changing.\"\n\nYou'd have written them too. There's nothing secret about it.\
    \ You just do it subliminally and unconsciously, because that's all enough, and\
    \ that's all I sang. That was all that was dear to me. They were the only kinds\
    \ of songs that made sense\n\n\"When you go down to Deep Ellum keep your money\
    \ in your socks / Women in Deep Ellum put you on the rocks.\" Sing that song for\
    \ a while and you just might come up with, \"When you're lost in the rain in Juarez\
    \ and it's Easter time too / And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull\
    \ you through / Don\u2019t put on any airs / When you\u2019re down on Rue Morgue\
    \ Avenue / They got some hungry women there / And they really make a mess outta\
    \ you.\"\n\nAll these songs are connected. Don't be fooled. I just opened up a\
    \ different door in a different kind of way. It's just different, saying the same\
    \ thing. I didn't think it was anything out of the ordinary\n\nWell you know,\
    \ I just thought I was doing something natural, but right from the start, my songs\
    \ were divisive for some reason. They divided people. I never knew why. Some got\
    \ angered, others loved them. Didn't know why my songs had detractors and supporters.\
    \ A strange environment to have to throw your songs into, but I did it anyway\n\
    \nLast thing I thought of was who cared about what song I was writing. I was just\
    \ writing them. I didn't think I was doing anything different. I thought I was\
    \ just extending the line. Maybe a little bit unruly, but I was just elaborating\
    \ on situations. Maybe hard to pin down, but so what? A lot of people are hard\
    \ to pin down. You've just got to bear it. I didn't really care what Lieber and\
    \ Stoller thought of my songs\n\nThey didn't like 'em, but Doc Pomus did. That\
    \ was all right that they didn't like 'em, because I never liked their songs either.\
    \ \"Yakety yak, don't talk back.\" \"Charlie Brown is a clown,\" \"Baby I'm a\
    \ hog for you.\" Novelty songs. They weren't saying anything serious. Doc's songs,\
    \ they were better. \"This Magic Moment.\" \"Lonely Avenue.\" Save the Last Dance\
    \ for Me\n\nThose songs broke my heart. I figured I'd rather have his blessings\
    \ any day than theirs\n\nAhmet Ertegun didn't think much of my songs, but Sam\
    \ Phillips did. Ahmet founded Atlantic Records. He produced some great records:\
    \ Ray Charles, Ray Brown, just to name a few\n\nThere were some great records\
    \ in there, no question about it. But Sam Phillips, he recorded Elvis and Jerry\

    \ the bone. Songs that cut you to the bone. Renegades in all degrees, doing songs\
    \ that would never decay, and still resound to this day. Oh, yeah, I'd rather\
    \ have Sam Phillips' blessing any day\n\nMerle Haggard didn't even think much\
    \ of my songs. I know he didn't. He didn't say that to me, but I know [inaudible].\
    \ Buck Owens did, and he recorded some of my early songs. Merle Haggard -- \"\

    \ imagine Waylon Jennings singing \"The Bottle Let Me Down.\"\n\n\"Together Again\"\
    ? That's Buck Owens, and that trumps anything coming out of Bakersfield. Buck\
    \ Owens and Merle Haggard? If you have to have somebody's blessing -- you figure\
    \ it out\n\nOh, yeah. Critics have been giving me a hard time since Day One. Critics\
    \ say I can't sing. I croak. Sound like a frog. Why don't critics say that same\
    \ thing about Tom Waits? Critics say my voice is shot. That I have no voice. What\
    \ don't they say those things about Leonard Cohen? Why do I get special treatment?\
    \ Critics say I can't carry a tune and I talk my way through a song. Really? I've\
    \ never heard that said about Lou Reed. Why does he get to go scot-free?\n\nYep.\

    \ The war,...\n\nWhat have I done to deserve this special attention? No vocal\
    \ range? When's the last time you heard Dr. John? Why don't you say that about\
    \ him? Slur my words, got no diction. Have you people ever listened to Charley\
    \ Patton or Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters. Talk about slurred words and no diction.\
    \ [Inaudible] doesn't even matter\n\n\"Why me, Lord?\" I would say that to myself\n\
    \nCritics say I mangle my melodies, render my songs unrecognizable. Oh, really?\
    \ Let me tell you something. I was at a boxing match a few years ago seeing Floyd\
    \ Mayweather fight a Puerto Rican guy. And the Puerto Rican national anthem, somebody\
    \ sang it and it was beautiful. It was heartfelt and it was moving\n\nAfter that\
    \ it was time for our national anthem. And a very popular soul-singing sister\
    \ was chosen to sing. She sang every note -- that exists, and some that don't\
    \ exist. Talk about mangling a melody. You take a one-syllable word and make it\
    \ last for 15 minutes? She was doing vocal gymnastics like she was on a trapeze\
    \ act. But to me it was not funny\n\nWhere were the critics? Mangling lyrics?\
    \ Mangling a melody? Mangling a treasured song? No, I get the blame. But I don't\
    \ really think I do that. I just think critics say I do\n\nSam Cooke said this\
    \ when told he had a beautiful voice: He said, \"Well that's very kind of you,\
    \ but voices ought not to be measured by how pretty they are. Instead they matter\
    \ only if they convince you that they are telling the truth.\" Think about that\
    \ the next time you [inaudible]\n\nTimes always change. They really do. And you\
    \ have to always be ready for something that's coming along and you never expected\
    \ it. Way back when, I was in Nashville making some records and I read this article,\
    \ a Tom T. Hall interview. Tom T. Hall, he was bitching about some kind of new\
    \ song, and he couldn't understand what these new kinds of songs that were coming\
    \ in were about\n\nNow Tom, he was one of the most preeminent songwriters of the\
    \ time in Nashville. A lot of people were recording his songs and he himself even\
    \ did it. But he was all in a fuss about James Taylor, a song James had called\
    \ \"Country Road.\" Tom was going off in this  interview -- \"But James don't\
    \ say nothing about a country road. He's just says how you can feel it on the\
    \ country road. I don't understand that.\"\n\nNow some might say Tom is a great\
    \ songwriter. I'm not going to doubt that. At the time he was doing this interview\
    \ I was actually listening to a song of his on the radio\n\nIt was called \"I\
    \ Love.\" I was listening to it in a recording studio, and he was talking about\
    \ all the things he loves, an everyman kind of song, trying to connect with people.\
    \ Trying to make you think that he's just like you and you're just like him. We\
    \ all love the same things, and we're all in this together. Tom loves little baby\
    \ ducks, slow-moving trains and rain. He loves old pickup trucks and little country\
    \ streams. Sleeping without dreams. Bourbon in a glass. Coffee in a cup. Tomatoes\
    \ on the vine, and onions\nNow listen, I'm not ever going to disparage another\
    \ songwriter. I'm not going to do that. I'm not saying it's a bad song. I'm just\
    \ saying it might be a little overcooked. But, you know, it was in the top 10\
    \ anyway. Tom and a few other writers had the whole Nashville scene sewed up in\
    \ a box. If you wanted to record a song and get it in the top 10 you had to go\
    \ to them, and Tom was one of the top guys. They were all very comfortable, doing\
    \ their thing\n\nThis was about the time that Willie Nelson picked up and moved\
    \ to Texas. About the same time. He's still in Texas. Everything was very copacetic.\
    \ Everything was all right until -- until -- Kristofferson came to town. Oh, they\
    \ ain't seen anybody like him. He came into town like a wildcat, flew his helicopter\
    \ into Johnny Cash's backyard like a typical songwriter. And he went for the throat.\

    AT 1:43 PM FEBRUARY 09, 2015\nADD A COMMENTSEE ALL COMMENTS\n45\n\nBut, you know,\
    \ I'm glad they mention their names, and you know what? I'm glad they got their\
    \ names in the press. It might have taken some time to do it, but they're finally\
    \ there. I can only wonder why it took so long. My only regret is that they're\
    \ not here to see it\n\nTraditional rock 'n' roll, we're talking about that. It's\
    \ all about rhythm. Johnny Cash said it best: \"Get rhythm. Get rhythm when you\
    \ get the blues.\" Very few rock 'n' roll bands today play with rhythm. They don't\
    \ know what it is. Rock 'n' roll is a combination of blues, and it's a strange\
    \ thing made up of two parts. A lot of people don't know this, but the blues,\
    \ which is an American music, is not what you think it is. It's a combination\
    \ of Arabic violins and Strauss waltzes working it out. But it's true\n\n\nThe\
    \ other half of rock 'n' roll has got to be hillbilly. And that's a derogatory\
    \ term, but it ought not to be. That's a term that includes the Delmore Bros.,\
    \ Stanley Bros., Roscoe Holcomb, Clarence Ashley ... groups like that. Moonshiners\
    \ gone berserk. Fast cars on dirt roads. That's the kind of combination that makes\
    \ up rock 'n' roll, and it can't be cooked up in a science laboratory or a studio\n\
    \nYou have to have the right kind of rhythm to play this kind of music. If you\
    \ can't hardly play the blues, how do you [inaudible] those other two kinds of\
    \ music in there? You can fake it, but you can't really do it\n\nCritics have\
    \ made a career out of accusing me of having a career of confounding expectations.\
    \ Really? Because that's all I do. That's how I think about it. Confounding expectations\n\
    \n\"What do you do for a living, man?\"\n\n\"Oh, I confound expectations.\"\n\n\
    You're going to get a job, the man says, \"What do you do?\" \"Oh, confound expectations.:\
    \ And the man says, \"Well, we already have that spot filled. Call us back. Or\
    \ don't call us, we'll call you.\" Confounding expectations. What does that mean?\
    \ 'Why me, Lord? I'd confound them, but I don't know how to do it.'\n\nThe Blackwood\
    \ Bros. have been talking to me about making a record together. That might confound\
    \ expectations, but it shouldn't. Of course it would be a gospel album. I don't\
    \ think it would be anything out of the ordinary for me. Not a bit. One of the\
    \ songs I'm thinking about singing is \"Stand By Me\" by the Blackwood Brothers.\
    \ Not \"Stand By Me\" the pop song. No. The real \"Stand By Me.\"\n\nThe real\
    \ one goes like this:\n\nWhen the storm of life is raging / Stand by me / When\
    \ the storm of life is raging / Stand by me / When the world is tossing me / Like\
    \ a ship upon the sea / Thou who rulest wind and water / Stand by me\n\nIn the\
    \ midst of tribulation / Stand by me / In the midst of tribulation / Stand by\
    \ me / When the hosts of hell assail / And my strength begins to fail / Thou who\
    \ never lost a battle / Stand by me\n\nIn the midst of faults and failures / Stand\
    \ by me / In the midst of faults and failures / Stand by me / When I do the best\
    \ I can / And my friends don't understand / Thou who knowest all about  me / Stand\
    \ by me\n\nThat's the song. I like it better than the pop song. If I record one\
    \ by that name, that's going to be the one. I'm also thinking of recording a song,\
    \ not on that album, though: \"Oh Lord, Please Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood.\"\
    \n\nAnyway, why me, Lord. What did I do?\n\nAnyway, I'm proud to be here tonight\
    \ for MusiCares. I'm honored to have all these artists singing my songs. There's\
    \ nothing like that. Great artists. [applause, inaudible]. They're all singing\
    \ the truth, and you can hear it in their voices\n\nI'm proud to be here tonight\
    \ for MusiCares. I think a lot of this organization. They've helped many people.\
    \ Many musicians who have contributed a lot to our culture. I'd like to personally\
    \ thank them for what they did for a friend of mine, Billy Lee Riley. A friend\
    \ of mine who they helped for six years when he was down and couldn't work. Billy\
    \ was a son of rock 'n' roll, obviously\n\n\nHe was a true original. He did it\
    \ all: He played, he sang, he wrote. He would have been a bigger star but Jerry\
    \ Lee came along. And you know what happens when someone like that comes along.\
    \ You just don't stand a chance\n\nSo Billy became what is known in the industry\
    \ -- a condescending term, by the way -- as a one-hit wonder. But sometimes, just\
    \ sometimes, once in a while, a one-hit wonder can make a more powerful impact\
    \ than a recording star who's got 20 or 30 hits behind him. And Billy's hit song\
    \ was called \"Red Hot,\" and it was red hot. It could blast you out of your skull\
    \ and make you feel happy about it. Change your life\n\nHe did it with style and\
    \ grace. You won't find him in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He's not there.\
    \ Metallica is. Abba is. Mamas and the Papas -- I know they're in there. Jefferson\
    \ Airplane, Alice Cooper, Steely Dan -- I've got nothing against them. Soft rock,\
    \ hard rock, psychedelic pop. I got nothing against any of that stuff, but after\
    \ all, it is called the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Billy Lee Riley is not there.\
    \ Yet\n\nI'd see him a couple times a year and we'd always spent time together\
    \ and he was on a rockabilly festival nostalgia circuit, and we'd cross paths\
    \ now and again. We'd always spend time together. He was a hero of mine. I'd heard\
    \ \"Red Hot.\" I must have been only 15 or 16 when I did and it's impressed me\
    \ to this day\n\nYep. A more gracious way to lament or \"woe is me\" the bad reviews:\
    \ I have to die a little Between each murderous thought And when I'm finished\
    \ thinking I have to die a lot There's torture and there's killing And there's\
    \ all my bad reviews The war,...\n\nI never grow tired of listening to it. Never\
    \ got tired of watching Billy Lee perform, either. We spent time together just\
    \ talking and playing into the night. He was a deep, truthful man. He wasn't bitter\
    \ or nostalgic. He just accepted it. He knew where he had come from and he was\
    \ content with who he was\n\nAnd then one day he got sick. And like my friend\
    \ John Mellencamp would sing -- because John sang some truth today -- one day\
    \ you get sick and you don't get better. That's from a song of his called \"Life\
    \ is Short Even on Its Longest Days.\" It's one of the better songs of the last\
    \ few years, actually. I ain't lying\n\nAnd I ain't lying when I tell you that\
    \ MusiCares paid for my friend's doctor bills, and helped him to get spending\
    \ money. They were able to at least make his life comfortable, tolerable to the\
    \ end. That is something that can't be repaid. Any organization that would do\
    \ that would have to have my blessing\n\nI'm going to get out of here now. I'm\
    \ going to put an egg in my shoe and beat it. I probably left out a lot of people\
    \ and said too much about some. But that's OK. Like the spiritual song, 'I'm still\
    \ just crossing over Jordan too.' Let's hope we meet again. Sometime. And we will,\
    \ if, like Hank Williams said, \"the good Lord willing and the creek don't rise.\"\

    She can make you steal, make you rob

    Give you the hives, make you lose your job

    Make things bad, she can make things worse

    She got stuff more potent than a gypsy curse

    One of these days, I''ll end up on the run

    I''m pretty sure, she''ll make me kill someone

    I''m going inside, roll the shutters down

  Networking - your secret weapon in the music industry: "In the dynamic world of\
    \ music, the journey from a raw, unpolished talent to a chart-topping sensation\
    \ it's not just about talent, unique voice or musical sound. So, what's the key?\
    \ Networking, communications and the ability to forge relationships, that can\
    \ help you come to success faster. And It's more than just the 'who you know'\
    \ adage; it's about business, collaborative growth, and shared success.\n\nThe\
    \ business aspect. Why networking matters in the music industry.\nIf you are still\
    \ thinking that music it's only about art, this means that you have never tried\
    \ to release a song. To understand th\u0435 importance of  relationships inside,\
    \ w\u0435 need to recognize that music, in its essence, is a business, and networking\
    \ serves as the backbone for new opportunities and growth.\n\nAn artist may create\
    \ magic in the studio, create and record musical masterpieces, but the business\
    \ side of things involves getting that magic out into the world, attracting listeners,\
    \ and monetizing the creation. Networking \u2014 it's the golden key that can\
    \ help artists maneuver these terrains successfully, bringing you face-to-face\
    \ with industry influencers, managers, producers, and fellow artists who can open\
    \ doors to possibilities.\n\nWhile talent is always an irreplaceable asset, your\
    \ connections can sometimes be that one step between success and stagnation. For\
    \ example, it's not just about cutting a record, but about building long-term\
    \ relationships that can place that record into the right hands, or help you with\
    \ some promotion then.\n\nNetworking: the crucial steps.\n\nThe first step in\
    \ your networking is to recognize and seize opportunities. You can attend industry\
    \ events, music conferences, workshops, and concerts, meet fellow musicians and\
    \ industry insiders, present your work and be open to feedback and collaboration.\
    \ But one of the most important things happens after \u2014 you need to stay in\
    \ touch with the people that you have met.\n\nAnd the next step is \u2014 you\
    \ need to build some special connection with every individual person.  Remember,\
    \ that is not about the thousands of people that you have met somewhere. It's\
    \ about building valuable, mutual relationships with people that really matter\
    \ for you.\n\nBut imagine if there was a way to simplify this process \u2014 a\
    \ tool that could help you to manage your networking efficiently and offer solutions\
    \ that will help us nurture and grow our relationships.\n\nWell, meet Nection\
    \ \u2014 a revolutionary mobile app that leverages the power of AI to help you\
    \ skyrocket your relationships, connections and your networking. At its core,\
    \ Nection is a relationship management app that brings all of your contacts in\
    \ one place and offers smart guidance, giving you reminders, tips and practical\
    \ advice to help you navigate your relationships and keep them more effectively.\n\
    \nAn AI assistant inside can remind you about the birthday of an important person,\
    \ schedule a coffee meeting, suggest the right message to send to someone at a\
    \ particular time or remind you to stay in touch with someone you haven't spoken\
    \ to in a while. Communicate, manage your connections from one place, build more\
    \ personalized connections and grow your networking to have more opportunities\
    \ for personal growth.\n\nThe art of building relationships in the music industry.\n\
    \nYear by year, the driving principle of any networking (and in the music industry\
    \ its not exception) remains the same. If you want to get a good relationship\
    \ \u2014 you need to work with them. Let's dive into some insights about how we\
    \ can build and maintain strong, quality and efficient relationships that will\
    \ reveal your personal growth and life in general.\n\nDon't have any chance to\
    \ forget or be forgotten. Remember birthdays or important dates, congratulate\
    \ peers on their success, and occasionally check in to see how they're doing.\
    \ Value the work of others as you'd want them to value yours. Celebrate the updates,\
    \ some achievements and success of your peers and give support in their journey.\n\
    See Bob Dylan LiveGet tickets as low as $57Communication it\u2019s about attention\
    \ to details. New job or new position in a company, moving, some achievements,\
    \ work or personal changes in life \u2014 when you have relevant information about\
    \ someone, you will be always ready to write a message based on the context that\
    \ will really break the ice.\n\nStay connected with the right people. And it's\
    \ not just about typical connections or small talks. Try to build warmer and deeper\
    \ relationships. Be honest and genuinely interested \u2014 that's always working!\
    \ People always sense when you're only after their contacts or influence.\n\n\
    We want this article to stand as a game-changer, even just for a while, and try\
    \ to change your perception about the importance of communications in the music\
    \ industry. Because networking \u2014 it's more than just a buzzword nowadays,\
    \ and it isn't something that happens overnight.\n\nNetworking in the music industry\
    \ isn't about knowing everyone; it's about knowing the right people and cultivating\
    \ meaningful relationships with them. It's not just about releasing your record;\
    \ it's about connecting with the right people who can amplify your reach and impact.\
    \ It's not just about being in the spotlight; it's about creating partnerships\
    \ and collaborations that can catapult your career to new heights.\n\nEffective\
    \ networking iIt takes some time, some effort and sometimes it may sound challenging.\

    \ new opportunities and personal growth."

  Nobel Prize Lecture in Literature (2017): "When I first received this Nobel Prize\
    \ for Literature, I got to wondering exactly how my songs related to literature.\
    \ I wanted to reflect on it and see where the connection was. I'm going to try\
    \ to articulate that to you. And most likely it will go in a roundabout way, but\
    \ I hope what I say will be worthwhile and purposeful.\n\nIf I was to go back\
    \ to the dawning of it all, I guess I'd have to start with Buddy Holly. Buddy\
    \ died when I was about eighteen and he was twenty-two. From the moment I first\
    \ heard him, I felt akin. I felt related, like he was an older brother. I even\
    \ thought I resembled him. Buddy played the music that I loved \u2013 the music\
    \ I grew up on: country western, rock \u2018n' roll, and rhythm and blues. Three\
    \ separate strands of music that he intertwined and infused into one genre. One\
    \ brand. And Buddy wrote songs \u2013 songs that had beautiful melodies and imaginative\
    \ verses. And he sang great \u2013 sang in more than a few voices. He was the\
    \ archetype. Everything I wasn't and wanted to be. I saw him only but once, and\
    \ that was a few days before he was gone. I had to travel a hundred miles to get\
    \ to see him play, and I wasn't disappointed.\n\nHe was powerful and electrifying\
    \ and had a commanding presence. I was only six feet away. He was mesmerizing.\
    \ I watched his face, his hands, the way he tapped his foot, his big black glasses,\
    \ the eyes behind the glasses, the way he held his guitar, the way he stood, his\
    \ neat suit. Everything about him. He looked older than twenty-two. Something\
    \ about him seemed permanent, and he filled me with conviction. Then, out of the\
    \ blue, the most uncanny thing happened. He looked me right straight dead in the\
    \ eye, and he transmitted something. Something I didn't know what. And it gave\
    \ me the chills.\n\nI think it was a day or two after that that his plane went\
    \ down. And somebody \u2013 somebody I'd never seen before \u2013 handed me a\
    \ Leadbelly record with the song \"Cottonfields\" on it. And that record changed\
    \ my life right then and there. Transported me into a world I'd never known. It\
    \ was like an explosion went off. Like I'd been walking in darkness and all of\
    \ the sudden the darkness was illuminated. It was like somebody laid hands on\
    \ me. I must have played that record a hundred times.\n\nIt was on a label I'd\
    \ never heard of with a booklet inside with advertisements for other artists on\
    \ the label: Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee, the New Lost City Ramblers, Jean\
    \ Ritchie, string bands. I'd never heard of any of them. But I reckoned if they\
    \ were on this label with Leadbelly, they had to be good, so I needed to hear\
    \ them. I wanted to know all about it and play that kind of music. I still had\
    \ a feeling for the music I'd grown up with, but for right now, I forgot about\
    \ it. Didn't even think about it. For the time being, it was long gone.\n\nI hadn't\
    \ left home yet, but I couldn't wait to. I wanted to learn this music and meet\
    \ the people who played it. Eventually, I did leave, and I did learn to play those\
    \ songs. They were different than the radio songs that I'd been listening to all\
    \ along. They were more vibrant and truthful to life. With radio songs, a performer\
    \ might get a hit with a roll of the dice or a fall of the cards, but that didn't\
    \ matter in the folk world. Everything was a hit. All you had to do was be well\
    \ versed and be able to play the melody. Some of these songs were easy, some not.\
    \ I had a natural feeling for the ancient ballads and country blues, but everything\
    \ else I had to learn from scratch. I was playing for small crowds, sometimes\
    \ no more than four or five people in a room or on a street corner. You had to\
    \ have a wide repertoire, and you had to know what to play and when. Some songs\
    \ were intimate, some you had to shout to be heard.\n\nBy listening to all the\
    \ early folk artists and singing the songs yourself, you pick up the vernacular.\
    \ You internalize it. You sing it in the ragtime blues, work songs, Georgia sea\
    \ shanties, Appalachian ballads and cowboy songs. You hear all the finer points,\
    \ and you learn the details.\n\nYou know what it's all about. Takin' the pistol\
    \ out and puttin' it back in your pocket. Whippin' your way through traffic, talkin'\
    \ in the dark. You know that Stagger Lee was a bad man and that Frankie was a\
    \ good girl. You know that Washington is a bourgeois town and you've heard the\
    \ deep-pitched voice of John the Revelator and you saw the Titanic sink in a boggy\
    \ creek. And you're pals with the wild Irish rover and the wild colonial boy.\
    \ You heard the muffled drums and the fifes that played lowly. You've seen the\
    \ lusty Lord Donald stick a knife in his wife, and a lot of your comrades have\
    \ been wrapped in white linen.\n\nI had all the vernacular down. I knew the rhetoric.\
    \ None of it went over my head \u2013 the devices, the techniques, the secrets,\
    \ the mysteries \u2013 and I knew all the deserted roads that it traveled on,\
    \ too. I could make it all connect and move with the current of the day. When\
    \ I started writing my own songs, the folk lingo was the only vocabulary that\
    \ I knew, and I used it.\n\nBut I had something else as well. I had principles\
    \ and sensibilities and an informed view of the world. And I had had that for\
    \ a while. Learned it all in grammar school. Don Quixote, Ivanhoe, Robinson Crusoe,\
    \ Gulliver's Travels, Tale of Two Cities, all the rest \u2013 typical grammar\
    \ school reading that gave you a way of looking at life, an understanding of human\
    \ nature, and a standard to measure things by. I took all that with me when I\
    \ started composing lyrics. And the themes from those books worked their way into\
    \ many of my songs, either knowingly or unintentionally. I wanted to write songs\
    \ unlike anything anybody ever heard, and these themes were fundamental.\n\nSpecific\
    \ books that have stuck with me ever since I read them way back in grammar school\
    \ \u2013 I want to tell you about three of them: Moby Dick, All Quiet on the Western\
    \ Front and The Odyssey.\n\n\nMoby Dick is a fascinating book, a book that's filled\
    \ with scenes of high drama and dramatic dialogue. The book makes demands on you.\
    \ The plot is straightforward. The mysterious Captain Ahab \u2013 captain of a\
    \ ship called the Pequod \u2013  an egomaniac with a peg leg pursuing his nemesis,\
    \ the great white whale Moby Dick who took his leg. And he pursues him all the\
    \ way from the Atlantic around the tip of Africa and into the Indian Ocean. He\
    \ pursues the whale around both sides of the earth. It's an abstract goal, nothing\
    \ concrete or definite. He calls Moby the emperor, sees him as the embodiment\
    \ of evil. Ahab's got a wife and child back in Nantucket that he reminisces about\
    \ now and again. You can anticipate what will happen.\n\nThe ship's crew is made\
    \ up of men of different races, and any one of them who sights the whale will\
    \ be given the reward of a gold coin. A lot of Zodiac symbols, religious allegory,\
    \ stereotypes. Ahab encounters other whaling vessels, presses the captains for\
    \ details about Moby. Have they seen him? There's a crazy prophet, Gabriel, on\
    \ one of the vessels, and he predicts Ahab's doom. Says Moby is the incarnate\
    \ of a Shaker god, and that any dealings with him will lead to disaster. He says\
    \ that to Captain Ahab. Another ship's captain \u2013 Captain Boomer \u2013 he\
    \ lost an arm to Moby. But he tolerates that, and he's happy to have survived.\
    \ He can't accept Ahab's lust for vengeance.\nSee Bob Dylan LiveGet tickets as\
    \ low as $57This book tells how different men react in different ways to the same\
    \ experience. A lot of Old Testament, biblical allegory: Gabriel, Rachel, Jeroboam,\
    \ Bildah, Elijah. Pagan names as well: Tashtego, Flask, Daggoo, Fleece, Starbuck,\
    \ Stubb, Martha's Vineyard. The Pagans are idol worshippers. Some worship little\
    \ wax figures, some wooden figures. Some worship fire. The Pequod is the name\
    \ of an Indian tribe.\n\nMoby Dick is a seafaring tale. One of the men, the narrator,\
    \ says, \"Call me Ishmael.\" Somebody asks him where he's from, and he says, \"\
    It's not down on any map. True places never are.\" Stubb gives no significance\
    \ to anything, says everything is predestined. Ishmael's been on a sailing ship\
    \ his entire life. Calls the sailing ships his Harvard and Yale. He keeps his\
    \ distance from people.\n\nA typhoon hits the Pequod. Captain Ahab thinks it's\
    \ a good omen. Starbuck thinks it's a bad omen, considers killing Ahab. As soon\
    \ as the storm ends, a crewmember falls from the ship's mast and drowns, foreshadowing\
    \ what's to come. A Quaker pacifist priest, who is actually a bloodthirsty businessman,\
    \ tells Flask, \"Some men who receive injuries are led to God, others are led\
    \ to bitterness.\"\n\nEverything is mixed in. All the myths: the Judeo Christian\
    \ bible, Hindu myths, British legends, Saint George, Perseus, Hercules \u2013\
    \ they're all whalers. Greek mythology, the gory business of cutting up a whale.\
    \ Lots of facts in this book, geographical knowledge, whale oil \u2013 good for\
    \ coronation of royalty \u2013 noble families in the whaling industry. Whale oil\
    \ is used to anoint the kings. History of the whale, phrenology, classical philosophy,\
    \ pseudo-scientific theories, justification for discrimination \u2013 everything\
    \ thrown in and none of it hardly rational. Highbrow, lowbrow, chasing illusion,\
    \ chasing death, the great white whale, white as polar bear, white as a white\
    \ man, the emperor, the nemesis, the embodiment of evil. The demented captain\
    \ who actually lost his leg years ago trying to attack Moby with a knife.\n\n\
    We see only the surface of things. We can interpret what lies below any way we\
    \ see fit. Crewmen walk around on deck listening for mermaids, and sharks and\
    \ vultures follow the ship. Reading skulls and faces like you read a book. Here's\
    \ a face. I'll put it in front of you. Read it if you can.\n\nTashtego says that\
    \ he died and was reborn. His extra days are a gift. He wasn't saved by Christ,\
    \ though, he says he was saved by a fellow man and a non-Christian at that. He\
    \ parodies the resurrection.\n\nWhen Starbuck tells Ahab that he should let bygones\
    \ be bygones, the angry captain snaps back, \"Speak not to me of blasphemy, man,\
    \ I'd strike the sun if it insulted me.\" Ahab, too, is a poet of eloquence. He\
    \ says, \"The path to my fixed purpose is laid with iron rails whereon my soul\
    \ is grooved to run.\"  Or these lines, \"All visible objects are but pasteboard\
    \ masks.\" Quotable poetic phrases that can't be beat.\n\nFinally, Ahab spots\
    \ Moby, and the harpoons come out. Boats are lowered. Ahab's harpoon has been\
    \ baptized in blood. Moby attacks Ahab's boat and destroys it. Next day, he sights\
    \ Moby again. Boats are lowered again. Moby attacks Ahab's boat again. On the\
    \ third day, another boat goes in. More religious allegory. He has risen. Moby\
    \ attacks one more time, ramming the Pequod and sinking it. Ahab gets tangled\
    \ up in the harpoon lines and is thrown out of his boat into a watery grave.\n\
    \nIshmael survives. He's in the sea floating on a coffin. And that's about it.\
    \ That's the whole story. That theme and all that it implies would work its way\
    \ into more than a few of my songs.\n\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front was another\
    \ book that did. All Quiet on the Western Front is a horror story. This is a book\
    \ where you lose your childhood, your faith in a meaningful world, and your concern\
    \ for individuals. You're stuck in a nightmare. Sucked up into a mysterious whirlpool\
    \ of death and pain. You're defending yourself from elimination. You're being\
    \ wiped off the face of the map. Once upon a time you were an innocent youth with\
    \ big dreams about being a concert pianist. Once you loved life and the world,\
    \ and now you're shooting it to pieces.\n\nDay after day, the hornets bite you\
    \ and worms lap your blood. You're a cornered animal. You don't fit anywhere.\
    \ The falling rain is monotonous. There's endless assaults, poison gas, nerve\
    \ gas, morphine, burning streams of gasoline, scavenging and scabbing for food,\
    \ influenza, typhus, dysentery. Life is breaking down all around you, and the\
    \ shells are whistling. This is the lower region of hell. Mud, barbed wire, rat-filled\
    \ trenches, rats eating the intestines of dead men, trenches filled with filth\
    \ and excrement. Someone shouts, \"Hey, you there. Stand and fight.\"\n\nWho knows\
    \ how long this mess will go on? Warfare has no limits. You're being annihilated,\
    \ and that leg of yours is bleeding too much. You killed a man yesterday, and\
    \ you spoke to his corpse. You told him after this is over, you'll spend the rest\
    \ of your life looking after his family. Who's profiting here? The leaders and\
    \ the generals gain fame, and many others profit financially. But you're doing\
    \ the dirty work. One of your comrades says, \"Wait a minute, where are you going?\"\
    \ And you say, \"Leave me alone, I'll be back in a minute.\" Then you walk out\
    \ into the woods of death hunting for a piece of sausage. You can't see how anybody\
    \ in civilian life has any kind of purpose at all. All their worries, all their\
    \ desires \u2013 you can't comprehend it.\n\nMore machine guns rattle, more parts\
    \ of bodies hanging from wires, more pieces of arms and legs and skulls where\
    \ butterflies perch on teeth, more hideous wounds, pus coming out of every pore,\
    \ lung wounds, wounds too big for the body, gas-blowing cadavers, and dead bodies\
    \ making retching noises. Death is everywhere. Nothing else is possible. Someone\
    \ will kill you and use your dead body for target practice. Boots, too. They're\
    \ your prized possession. But soon they'll be on somebody else's feet.\nThere's\
    \ Froggies coming through the trees. Merciless bastards. Your shells are running\
    \ out. \"It's not fair to come at us again so soon,\" you say. One of your companions\
    \ is laying in the dirt, and you want to take him to the field hospital. Someone\
    \ else says, \"You might save yourself a trip.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"Turn\
    \ him over, you'll see what I mean.\"\n\nYou wait to hear the news. You don't\
    \ understand why the war isn't over. The army is so strapped for replacement troops\
    \ that they're drafting young boys who are of little military use, but they're\
    \ draftin' \u2018em anyway because they're running out of men. Sickness and humiliation\
    \ have broken your heart. You were betrayed by your parents, your schoolmasters,\
    \ your ministers, and even your own government.\n\nThe general with the slowly\
    \ smoked cigar betrayed you too \u2013 turned you into a thug and a murderer.\
    \ If you could, you'd put a bullet in his face. The commander as well. You fantasize\
    \ that if you had the money, you'd put up a reward for any man who would take\
    \ his life by any means necessary. And if he should lose his life by doing that,\
    \ then let the money go to his heirs. The colonel, too, with his caviar and his\
    \ coffee \u2013 he's another one. Spends all his time in the officers' brothel.\
    \ You'd like to see him stoned dead too. More Tommies and Johnnies with their\
    \ whack fo' me daddy-o and their whiskey in the jars. You kill twenty of \u2018\
    em and twenty more will spring up in their place. It just stinks in your nostrils.\n\
    \nYou've come to despise that older generation that sent you out into this madness,\
    \ into this torture chamber. All around you, your comrades are dying. Dying from\
    \ abdominal wounds, double amputations, shattered hipbones, and you think, \"\
    I'm only twenty years old, but I'm capable of killing anybody. Even my father\
    \ if he came at me.\"\n\nYesterday, you tried to save a wounded messenger dog,\
    \ and somebody shouted, \"Don't be a fool.\" One Froggy is laying gurgling at\
    \ your feet. You stuck him with a dagger in his stomach, but the man still lives.\
    \ You know you should finish the job, but you can't. You're on the real iron cross,\
    \ and a Roman soldier's putting a sponge of vinegar to your lips.\n\nMonths pass\
    \ by. You go home on leave. You can't communicate with your father. He said, \"\
    You'd be a coward if you don't enlist.\" Your mother, too, on your way back out\
    \ the door, she says, \"You be careful of those French girls now.\" More madness.\
    \ You fight for a week or a month, and you gain ten yards. And then the next month\
    \ it gets taken back.\n\nAll that culture from a thousand years ago, that philosophy,\
    \ that wisdom \u2013 Plato, Aristotle, Socrates \u2013 what happened to it?  It\
    \ should have prevented this. Your thoughts turn homeward. And once again you're\
    \ a schoolboy walking through the tall poplar trees. It's a pleasant memory. More\
    \ bombs dropping on you from blimps. You got to get it together now. You can't\
    \ even look at anybody for fear of some miscalculable thing that might happen.\
    \ The common grave. There are no other possibilities.\n\nThen you notice the cherry\
    \ blossoms, and you see that nature is unaffected by all this. Poplar trees, the\
    \ red butterflies, the fragile beauty of flowers, the sun \u2013 you see how nature\
    \ is indifferent to it all. All the violence and suffering of all mankind. Nature\
    \ doesn't even notice it.\n\nYou're so alone. Then a piece of shrapnel hits the\
    \ side of your head and you're dead.\nYou've been ruled out, crossed out. You've\
    \ been exterminated. I put this book down and closed it up. I never wanted to\
    \ read another war novel again, and I never did.\n\nCharlie Poole from North Carolina\
    \ had a song that connected to all this. It's called \"You Ain't Talkin' to Me,\"\
    \ and the lyrics go like this:\n\nI saw a sign in a window walking up town one\
    \ day.\nJoin the army, see the world is what it had to say.\nYou'll see exciting\
    \ places with a jolly crew,\nYou'll meet interesting people, and learn to kill\
    \ them too.\nOh you ain't talkin' to me, you ain't talking to me.\nI may be crazy\
    \ and all that, but I got good sense you see.\nYou ain't talkin' to me, you ain't\
    \ talkin' to me.\nKillin' with a gun don't sound like fun.\nYou ain't talkin'\
    \ to me.\n\nThe Odyssey is a great book whose themes have worked its way into\
    \ the ballads of a lot of songwriters: \"Homeward Bound, \"Green, Green Grass\
    \ of Home,\" \"Home on the Range,\" and my songs as well.\n\nThe Odyssey is a\
    \ strange, adventurous tale of a grown man trying to get home after fighting in\
    \ a war. He's on that long journey home, and it's filled with traps and pitfalls.\
    \ He's cursed to wander. He's always getting carried out to sea, always having\
    \ close calls. Huge chunks of boulders rock his boat. He angers people he shouldn't.\
    \ There's troublemakers in his crew. Treachery. His men are turned into pigs and\
    \ then are turned back into younger, more handsome men. He's always trying to\
    \ rescue somebody. He's a travelin' man, but he's making a lot of stops.\n\nHe's\
    \ stranded on a desert island. He finds deserted caves, and he hides in them.\
    \ He meets giants that say, \"I'll eat you last.\" And he escapes from giants.\
    \ He's trying to get back home, but he's tossed and turned by the winds. Restless\
    \ winds, chilly winds, unfriendly winds. He travels far, and then he gets blown\
    \ back.\n\nHe's always being warned of things to come. Touching things he's told\
    \ not to. There's two roads to take, and they're both bad. Both hazardous. On\
    \ one you could drown and on the other you could starve. He goes into the narrow\
    \ straits with foaming whirlpools that swallow him. Meets six-headed monsters\
    \ with sharp fangs. Thunderbolts strike at him. Overhanging branches that he makes\
    \ a leap to reach for to save himself from a raging river. Goddesses and gods\
    \ protect him, but some others want to kill him. He changes identities. He's exhausted.\
    \ He falls asleep, and he's woken up by the sound of laughter. He tells his story\
    \ to strangers. He's been gone twenty years. He was carried off somewhere and\
    \ left there. Drugs have been dropped into his wine. It's been a hard road to\
    \ travel.\n\nIn a lot of ways, some of these same things have happened to you.\
    \ You too have had drugs dropped into your wine. You too have shared a bed with\
    \ the wrong woman. You too have been spellbound by magical voices, sweet voices\
    \ with strange melodies. You too have come so far and have been so far blown back.\
    \ And you've had close calls as well. You have angered people you should not have.\
    \ And you too have rambled this country all around. And you've also felt that\
    \ ill wind, the one that blows you no good. And that's still not all of it.\n\n\
    When he gets back home, things aren't any better. Scoundrels have moved in and\
    \ are taking advantage of his wife's hospitality. And there's too many of \u2018\
    em. And though he's greater than them all and the best at everything \u2013 best\
    \ carpenter, best hunter, best expert on animals, best seaman \u2013 his courage\
    \ won't save him, but his trickery will.\n\nAll these stragglers will have to\
    \ pay for desecrating his palace. He'll disguise himself as a filthy beggar, and\
    \ a lowly servant kicks him down the steps with arrogance and stupidity. The servant's\
    \ arrogance revolts him, but he controls his anger. He's one against a hundred,\
    \ but they'll all fall, even the strongest. He was nobody. And when it's all said\
    \ and done, when he's home at last, he sits with his wife, and he tells her the\
    \ stories.\n\n***\n\nSo what does it all mean? Myself and a lot of other songwriters\
    \ have been influenced by these very same themes. And they can mean a lot of different\
    \ things. If a song moves you, that's all that's important. I don't have to know\
    \ what a song means. I've written all kinds of things into my songs. And I'm not\
    \ going to worry about it \u2013 what it all means. When Melville put all his\
    \ old testament, biblical references, scientific theories, Protestant doctrines,\
    \ and all that knowledge of the sea and sailing ships and whales into one story,\
    \ I don't think he would have worried about it either \u2013 what it all means.\n\
    \nJohn Donne as well, the poet-priest who lived in the time of Shakespeare, wrote\
    \ these words, \"The Sestos and Abydos of her breasts. Not of two lovers, but\
    \ two loves, the nests.\" I don't know what it means, either. But it sounds good.\
    \ And you want your songs to sound good.\n\nWhen Odysseus in The Odyssey visits\
    \ the famed warrior Achilles in the underworld \u2013 Achilles, who traded a long\
    \ life full of peace and contentment for a short one full of honor and glory \u2013\
    \  tells Odysseus it was all a mistake. \"I just died, that's all.\" There was\
    \ no honor. No immortality. And that if he could, he would choose to go back and\
    \ be a lowly slave to a tenant farmer on Earth rather than be what he is \u2013\
    \ a king in the land of the dead \u2013 that whatever his struggles of life were,\
    \ they were preferable to being here in this dead place.\n\nThat's what songs\
    \ are too. Our songs are alive in the land of the living. But songs are unlike\
    \ literature. They're meant to be sung, not read. The words in Shakespeare's plays\
    \ were meant to be acted on the stage. Just as lyrics in songs are meant to be\
    \ sung, not read on a page. And I hope some of you get the chance to listen to\
    \ these lyrics the way they were intended to be heard: in concert or on record\
    \ or however people are listening to songs these days. I return once again to\
    \ Homer, who says, \"Sing in me, oh Muse, and through me tell the story.\"1"

  North Country Blues: '[Verse 1]

    Come an'' gather ''round friends

    And I''ll tell ya a tale

    Of when the red iron ore pits ran a-plenty

    But the cardboard filled windows

    And old men on the benches

    Tell you now that the whole town is empty


    [Verse 2]

    In the north end of town

    My own children are grown

    Well I was raised on the other

    In the wee hours of youth

    My mother took sick

    And I was brought up by my brother


    [Verse 3]

    The iron ore poured

    As the years passed the door

    The drag lines and the shovels they was a-hummin''

    ''Til one day my brother

    Failed to come home

    The same as my father before him


    [Verse 4]

    Well a long winter''s wait

    From the winda'' I watched

    My friends they couldn''ta been kinder

    And my schooling was cut

    As I quit in the spring

    To marry John Thomas, a miner

    Oh the years passed again

    And the givin'' was good

    With the lunch bucket filled every season

    What with three babies born

    The work was cut down

    To a half a day''s shift with no reason


    [Verse 6]

    Then the shaft was soon shut

    And more work was cut

    And the fire in the air, it felt frozen

    ''Til a man come to speak

    And he said in one week

    That number eleven was closin''


    [Verse 7]

    They complained in the East

    They''re payin'' too high

    They say that your ore ain''t worth a-diggin''

    That it''s much cheaper down

    In the South American towns

    Where the miners work almost for nothin''


    [Verse 8]

    So the minin'' gates locked

    And the red iron rotted

    And the room smelled heavy from drinkin''

    When the sad silent song

    Made the hour twice as long

    As I waited for the sun to go sinking

    [Verse 9]

    I lived by the window

    As he talked to himself

    This silence of tongues it was buildin''

    ''Til one morning''s wake

    The bed it was bare

    And I''s left alone with three children

    The summer is gone

  Polka Dots and Moonbeams: '[Verse 1]

    A country dance was being held in a garden

    I felt a bump and heard an, "Oh, beg your pardon"

    Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams

    All around a pug-nosed dream


    [Verse 2]

    The music started and was I the perplexed one?

    I held my breath and said, "May I have the next one?"

    In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams

    Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream


    [Verse 3]

    There were questions in the eyes of other dancers

    As we floated over the floor

    There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

    And perhaps a few things more


    [Verse 4]

    Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter

    I know the meaning of the words, "ever after"

    And I''ll always see polka dots and moonbeams

    But I always figured he could go home

    Til when he''d gave me his card and said, "Save it"

    From the girl from the Red River Shore


    [Verse 6]

    Well, I''m a stranger here in a strange land

    But I know this is where I belong

    I''ll ramble and gamble for the one I love

    And the hills will give me a song

    Though nothing looks familiar to me

    I know I''ve stayed here before

    Once, a thousand nights ago

    With the girl from the Red River Shore

    [Verse 7]

    Well, I went back to see about her once

    Went back to straighten it out

    Everybody that I talked to had seen us there

    Said they didn''t know who I was talking about

    Well, the sun went down on me a long time ago

    I had to go back from the door

    I wish I could have spent every hour of my life

    With the girl from the Red River Shore


    [Verse 8]

    Now I heard of a guy who lived a long time ago

    A man full of sorrow and strife

    That if someone around him died and was dead

    He knew how to bring ''em on back to life

    Well, I don''t know what kind of language he used

    Or if they do that kind of thing anymore

    Sometimes I think nobody saw me here at all

  Restless Farewell: '[Verse 1]

    Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend

    Be it mine right or wrongfully

    I let it slip gladly to my friends

    To tie up the time most forcefully


    [Chorus]

    But the bottles are done, we''ve killed each one

    And the table''s full and overflowed

    And the corner sign says it''s closin'' time

    So I''ll bid farewell and be down the road


    [Verse 2]

    Oh, every girl that ever I''ve touched

    I did not do it harmfully

    And every girl that ever I''ve hurt

    I did not do it knowingly


    [Chorus]

    But to remain as friends you need the time

    To make amends and stay behind

    And since my feet are now fast and point away from the past

    I''ll bid farewell and be down the line


    [Verse 3]

    Oh, every foe that ever I faced

    The cause was there before we came

    And every cause that ever I fought

    I fought it full without regret or shame

    And somebody''s eyes must meet the dawn

    And if I see the day, I''d only have to stay

    So I''ll bid farewell in the night and be gone


    [Verse 4]

    Oh, every thought that''s strung a knot in my mind

    I might go insane if it couldn''t be sprung

    But it''s not to stand naked under unknowin'' eyes

    It''s for myself and my friends my stories are sung


    [Chorus]

    But the time ain''t tall, if on time you depend

    And no word is possessed by no special friend

    And though the line is cut, it ain''t quite the end

    I''ll just bid farewell ''til we meet again


    [Verse 5]

    Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time

    To disgrace, distract and bother me

    And the dirt of gossip blows into my face

    And the dust of rumors covers me


    [Chorus]

    But if the arrow is straight and the point is slick

    It can pierce through dust no matter how thick

    So I''ll make my stand and remain as I am

  Shelter from the Storm: '[Verse 1]

    ''Twas in another lifetime

    One of toil and blood

    When blackness was a virtue

    The road was full of mud

    I came in from the wilderness

    A creature void of form

    "Come in," she said, "I''ll give ya

    Shelter from the storm"


    [Verse 2]

    And if I pass this way again

    You can rest assured

    I''ll always do my best for her

    On that I give my word

    In a world of steel-eyed death and men

    Who are fighting to be warm

    "Come in," she said, "I''ll give ya

    Shelter from the storm"


    [Verse 3]

    Not a word was spoke between us

    There was little risk involved

    Everything up to that point

    Had been left unresolved

    Try imagining a place

    Where it''s always safe and warm

    "Come in," she said, "I''ll give ya

    Shelter from the storm"

    I was burned out from exhaustion

    Buried in the hail

    Poisoned in the bushes

    And blown out on the trail

    Hunted like a crocodile

    Ravaged in the corn

    "Come in," she said, "I''ll give ya

    Shelter from the storm"


    [Verse 5]

    Suddenly I turned around

    And she was standing there

    With silver bracelets on her wrists

    And flowers in her hair

    She walked up to me so gracefully

    And took my crown of thorns

    "Come in," she said, "I''ll give ya

    Shelter from the storm"


    [Verse 6]

    Now there''s a wall between us

    Something there''s been lost

    I took too much for granted

    I got my signals crossed

    Just to think that it all began

    On an uneventful morn

    "Come in," she said, "I''ll give ya

    Shelter from the storm"

    [Verse 7]

    Well, the deputy walks on hard nails

    And the preacher rides a mount

    But nothing really matters much

    It''s doom alone that counts

    And the one-eyed undertaker

    He blows a futile horn

    "Come in," she said, "I''ll give ya

    Shelter from the storm


    [Verse 8]

    I''ve heard newborn babies wailing

    Like a mourning dove

    And old men with broken teeth

    Stranded without love

    Do I understand your question, then

    Is it hopeless and forlorn

    "Come in," she said, "I''ll give ya

    Shelter from the storm"


    [Verse 9]

    In a little hilltop village

    They gambled for my clothes

    I bargained for salvation

    And she gave me a lethal dose

    I offered up my innocence

    And I got repaid with scorn

    "Come in," she said, "I''ll give ya

    Shelter from the storm"

    [Verse 10]

    Well, I''m living in a foreign country

    But I''m bound to cross the line

    Beauty walks a razor''s edge

    Someday I''ll make it mine

    If I could only turn back the clock

    To when God and her were born

    "Come in," she said, "I''ll give ya

    Shelter from the storm"15'

    And stopped into a strange hotel

    With a neon burning bright

    He felt the heat of the night

    Hit him like a freight train

    Moving with a simple twist of fate


    [Verse 3]

    A saxophone someplace far-off played

    As she was walking on by the arcade

    As the light bust through a beat-up shade

    Where he was wakin'' up

    She dropped a coin into the cup

    Of a blind man at the gate

    And forgot about a simple twist of fate

    [Verse 4]

    He woke up, the room was bare

    He didn''t see her anywhere

    He told himself he didn''t care

    Pushed the window open wide

    Felt an emptiness inside

    To which he just could not relate

    Brought on by a simple twist of fate

    [Verse 5]

    He hears the ticking of the clocks

    And walks along with a parrot that talks

    Hunts her down by the waterfront docks

    Where the sailors all come in

    Maybe she''ll pick him out again

    How long must he wait?

    One more time, for a simple twist of fate


    [Verse 6]

    People tell me it''s a sin

    To know and feel too much within

    I still believe she was my twin

    But I lost the ring

    She was born in spring

    But I was born too late

    Blame it on a simple twist of fate17'

    Well, I run right down ''n'' bought a ticket

    To this Bear Mountain Picnic

    But little did I realize

    I was in for a picnic surprise

    Had nothin'' to do with mountains

    I didn''t even come close to a bear


    [Verse 3]

    Took the wife ''n'' kids down to the pier

    Six thousand people there

    Everybody had a ticket for the trip

    "Oh well." I said, "it''s a pretty big ship

    Besides, anyway, the more the merrier."


    [Verse 4]

    Well, we all got on ''n'' what d''ya think

    That big old boat started t'' sink

    More people kept a-pilin'' on

    That old ship was a-slowly goin'' down

    So many people there I never saw in m'' life

    That old ship sinkin'' down in the water

    I got shoved down ''n'' pushed around

    All I could hear there was a screamin'' sound

    Don''t remember one thing more

    Just remember walkin'' up on a little shore

    Head busted, stomach cracked

    Feet splintered, I was bald, naked...

    Quite lucky to be alive though


    [Verse 7]

    Feelin'' like I climbed outta m'' casket

    I grabbed back hold of m'' picnic basket

    Took the wife ''n'' kids ''n'' started home

    Wishin'' I''d never got up that morn

  Talking World War III Blues: 'Some time ago a crazy dream came to me

    I dreamt, I was walkin'' into World War III

    I went to the doctor the very next day

    To see what kinda words he could say

    He said, "It was a bad dream"

    I wouldn''t worry ''bout it none, though

    They were my own dreams

    And they''re only in my head

    I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain"

    He said, "Nurse, get your pad, this boy''s insane"

    He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch"

    As I landed on the psychiatric couch

    He said, "Tell me about it"

    Well, the whole thing started at 3 o''clock fast

    It was all over by quarter past

    I was down in the sewer with some little lover

    When I peeked out from a manhole cover

    Wonderin'' who turned the lights on us

    Well, I got up and walked around

    And up and down the lonesome town

    I stood a-wonderin'' which way to go

    I lit a cigarette on a parkin'' meter

    And walked on down the road, it was a normal day

    Well, I rung me fallout shelter bell

    And I leaned my head and I gave a yell

    "Give me a string bean, I''m a hungry man"

    Shotgun fired and away I ran

    I don''t blame ''em too much though

    They didn''t know me

    Down at the corner by a hot-dog stand

    I seen a man, I said, "Howdy friend

    I guess there''s just us two"

    He screamed a bit and away he flew

    Thought I was a communist

    Well, I spied me a girl and before she could leave

    Say, "Let''s go and play Adam and Eve"

    I took her by the hand and my heart it was thumpin''

    When she said, "Hey man, you crazy or sumpin''

    You see what happened last time they started"

    Well, I seen a Cadillac window uptown

    And there was nobody aroun''

    I got into the driver''s seat

    And I drove down 42nd street, in my Cadillac

    Good car to drive after a war

    Well, I remember seein'' some ad

    So I turned on my Conelrad

    But I didn''t pay my Con Ed bill

    So the radio didn''t work so well

    Turned on my player

    It was rock-a-day, Johnny singin''

    "Tell your ma, tell your pa

    Our loves are gonna grow ooh-wah, ooh-wah"

    I was feelin'' kinda lonesome and blue

    I needed somebody to talk to

    So I called up the operator of time

    Just to hear a voice of some kind

    "When you hear the beep, it will be three o''clock"

    She said that for over an hour and I hung it up

    Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then

    Sayin'', "Hey, I''ve been havin'' the same old dreams

    But mine was a little different you see

    I dreamt that the only person left after the war was me

    I didn''t see you around"

    Well, now time passed and now it seems

    Everybody''s havin'' them dreams

    Everybody sees themselves

    Some of the people can be all right part of the time

  Tangled Up in Blue: '[Verse 1]

    Early one morning the sun was shining

    I was laying in bed

    Wondering if she''d changed at all

    If her hair was still red

    Her folks they said our lives together

    Sure was going to be rough

    They never did like Mama''s homemade dress

    Papa''s bankbook wasn''t big enough

    And I was standing on the side of the road

    Rain falling on my shoes

    Heading out for the East Coast

    Lord knows I''ve paid some dues

    Getting through

    Tangled up in blue


    [Verse 2]

    She was married when we first met

    Soon to be divorced

    I helped her out of a jam, I guess

    But I used a little too much force

    We drove that car as far as we could

    Abandoned it out west

    Split up on a dark sad night

    Both agreeing it was best

    She turned around to look at me

    As I was walking away

    I heard her say over my shoulder

    I had a job in the great north woods

    Working as a cook for a spell

    But I never did like it all that much

    And one day the ax just fell

    So I drifted down to New Orleans

    Where I lucky was to be employed

    Working for a while on a fishing boat

    Right outside of Delacroix

    But all the while I was alone

    The past was close behind

    I seen a lot of women

    But she never escaped my mind

    And I just grew

    She was working in a topless place

    And I stopped in for a beer

    I just kept looking at the side of her face

    In the spotlight, so clear

    And later on, when the crowd thinned out

    I was just about to do the same

    She was standing there, in back of my chair

    Said, "Tell me, don''t I know your name?"

    I muttered something underneath my breath

    She studied the lines on my face

    I must admit, I felt a little uneasy

    When she bent down to tie the laces

    Of my shoe

    Tangled up in blue

    [Verse 5]

    She lit a burner on the stove

    And offered me a pipe

    "I thought you''d never say hello," she said

    "You look like the silent type"

    Then she opened up a book of poems

    And handed it to me

    Written by an Italian poet

    From the thirteenth century

    And every one of them words rang true

    And glowed like burning coal

    Pouring off of every page

    Like it was written in my soul

    From me to you

    Tangled up in blue


    [Verse 6]

    I lived with them on Montague Street

    In a basement down the stairs

    There was music in the cafes at night

    And revolution in the air

    Then he started into dealing with slaves

    And something inside of him died

    She had to sell everything she owned

    And froze up inside

    And when it finally, the bottom fell out

    I became withdrawn

    The only thing I knew how to do

    Was to keep on keeping on

    Like a bird that flew

    Tangled up in blue

    [Verse 7]

    So now I''m going back again

    I got to get to her somehow

    All the people we used to know

    They''re an illusion to me now

    Some are mathematicians

    Some are carpenter''s wives

    Don''t know how it all got started

    I don''t know what they''re doing with their lives

    But me, I''m still on the road

    A-heading for another joint

    Everybody feared him that ever heard him cry

    When he begins to bellow it made such melodious sound

    Till all the walls in London came tumbling to the ground

    Sing taddle o day


    I buyed me a flock of sheep, I thought they were all wethers

    Sometimes they yielded wool, sometimes they yielded feathers

    I think mine are the very best sheep for yielding me increase

    For every full and change of the moon they bring both lambs and geese

    Sing taddle o day


    I buyed me a little box about four acres square

    I filled it full of guineas and silver so fair

    Oh now I''m bound for Turkey, I''ll travel like an ox

    In my breeches pocket, I''ll carry my little box

    Sing taddle o day


    I buyed me a little hen, all speckled gay and fair

    I sat her on an oyster shell, she hatched me out a hare

    The hare it sprang a handsome horse full fifteen hands high

    And him that tells a bigger tale would have to tell a lie

  "Tell Ol\u2019 Bill (Alternate Version, North Country Soundtrack)": 'The river whispers
    in my ear

    I''ve hardly a penny to my name

    The heavens never seemed so near

    All of my body glows with flame


    The tempest struggles in the air

    And to myself alone I sing

    It could sink me then and there

    I can hear the echoes ring


    I tried to find one smiling face

    To drive the shadow from my head

    I''m stranded in this nameless place

    Lying restless in a heavy bed


    Tell me straight out if you will

    Why must you torture me within?

    Why must you come from your high hill?

    Throw my fate to the clouds and wind


    Far away in a silent land

    Secret thoughts are hard to bear

    Remember me, you''ll understand

    Emotions we can never share


    You trampled on me as you passed

    Left the coldest kiss upon my brow

    All of my doubts and fears have gone at last

    I''ve nothing more to tell you now

    As each new season''s dawn awaits

    I lay awake at night with troubled dreams

    The enemy is at the gates


    Beneath the thunder blasted trees

    The words are ringin'' off your tongue

    The ground is hard in times like these

    The stars are cold, the night is young


    The rocks are bleak, the trees are bare

    Iron clouds go floating by

    Snowflakes fallin'' in my hair

    Beneath the gray and stormy sky


    The evenin'' sun is sinkin'' low

    The woods are dark, the town is too

    They''ll drag you down, they''ll run the show

    Ain''t no telling what they''ll do


    Tell ol'' Bill when he comes home

    That anything is worth a try

    Tell him that I''m not alone

    And that the hour has come to do or die


    All the world I would defy

    Let me make it plain as day

    I look at you now and I sigh

    How could it be any other way?2'
  Tempest: '[Verse 1]

    The pale moon rose in its glory

    Out o''er the Western town

    She told a sad, sad story

    Of the great ship that went down


    [Verse 2]

    T''was the fourteenth day of April

    Over the waves she rode

    Sailing into tomorrow

    To a gilded age foretold


    [Verse 3]

    The night was black with starlight

    The seas were sharp and clear

    Moving through the shadows

    The promised hour was near


    [Verse 4]

    Lights were holding steady

    Gliding over the foam

    All the lords and ladies

    Heading for their eternal home


    [Verse 5]

    The chandeliers were swaying

    From the balustrades above

    The orchestra was playing

    Songs of faded love

    The watchman, he lay dreaming

    As the ballroom dancers twirled

    He dreamed the Titanic was sinking

    Into the underworld


    [Verse 7]

    Leo took his sketchbook

    He was often so inclined

    He closed his eyes and painted

    The scenery in his mind


    [Verse 8]

    Cupid struck his bosom

    And broke it with a snap

    The closest woman to him

    He fell into her lap


    [Verse 9]

    He heard a loud commotion

    Something sounded wrong

    His inner spirit was saying

    That he couldn''t stand here long


    [Verse 10]

    He staggered to the quarterdeck

    No time now to sleep

    Water on the quarterdeck

    Already three foot deep

    [Verse 11]

    Smokestack was leaning sideways

    Heavy feet began to pound

    He walked into the whirlwind

    Sky splitting all around


    [Verse 12]

    The ship was going under

    The universe had opened wide

    The roll was called up yonder

    The angels turned aside


    [Verse 13]

    Lights down in the hallway

    Flickering dim and dull

    Dead bodies already floating

    In the double bottom hull


    [Verse 14]

    The engines then exploded

    Propellers they failed to start

    The boilers overloaded

    The ship''s bow split apart


    [Verse 15]

    Passengers were flying

    Backward, forward, far and fast

    They mumbled, fumbled, and tumbled

    Each one more weary than the last

    [Verse 16]

    The veil was torn asunder

    ''Tween the hours of twelve and one

    No change, no sudden wonder

    Could undo what had been done


    [Verse 17]

    The watchman lay there dreaming

    At forty-five degrees

    He dreamed that the Titanic was sinking

    Dropping to her knees


    [Verse 18]

    Wellington he was sleeping

    His bed began to slide

    His valiant heart was beating

    He pushed the tables aside


    [Verse 19]

    Glass of shattered crystal

    Lay scattered roundabout

    He strapped on both his pistols

    How long could he hold out?


    [Verse 20]

    His men and his companions

    Were nowhere to be seen

    In silence there he waited for

    Time and space to intervene


    [Verse 21]

    The passageway was narrow

    There was blackness in the air

    He saw every kind of sorrow

    Heard voices everywhere


    [Verse 22]

    Alarm-bells were ringing

    To hold back the swelling tide

    Friends and lovers clinging

    To each other side by side


    [Verse 23]

    Mothers and their daughters

    Descending down the stairs

    Jumped into the icy waters

    Love and pity sent their prayers


    [Verse 24]

    The rich man, Mister Astor

    Kissed his darling wife

    He had no way of knowing

    Be the last trip of his life


    [Verse 25]

    Calvin, Blake, and Wilson

    Gambled in the dark

    Not one of them would ever live to

    Tell the tale or disembark


    [Verse 26]

    Brother rose up ''gainst brother

    In every circumstance

    They fought and slaughtered each other

    In a deadly dance


    [Verse 27]

    They lowered down the lifeboats

    From the sinking wreck

    There were traitors, there were turncoats

    Broken backs and broken necks


    [Verse 28]

    The bishop left his cabin

    To help all those in need

    Turned his eyes up to the heavens

    Said, "The poor are yours to feed"


    [Verse 29]

    Davey the brothel-keeper

    Came out dismissed his girls

    Saw the water getting deeper

    Saw the changing of his world


    [Verse 30]

    Jim Backus smiled

    He never learned to swim

    Saw the little crippled child

    And he gave his seat to him


    [Verse 31]

    He saw the starlight shining

    Streaming from the East

    Death was on the rampage

    But his heart was now at peace


    [Verse 32]

    They battened down the hatches

    But the hatches wouldn''t hold

    They drowned upon the staircase

    Of brass and polished gold


    [Verse 33]

    Leo said to Cleo

    I think I''m going mad

    But he''d lost his mind already

    Whatever mind he had


    [Verse 34]

    He tried to block the doorway

    To save all those from harm

    Blood from an open wound

    Pouring down his arm


    [Verse 35]

    Petals fell from flowers

    Tell all of them were gone

    In the long and dreadful hours

    The wizard''s curse played on


    [Verse 36]

    The host was pouring brandy

    He was going down slow

    He stayed right to the end and he

    Was the last to go


    [Verse 37]

    There were many, many others

    Nameless here forever more

    They never sailed the ocean

    Or left their homes before


    [Verse 38]

    The watchman, he lay dreaming

    The damage had been done

    He dreamed the Titanic was sinking

    And he tried to tell someone


    [Verse 39]

    The captain, barely breathing

    Kneeling at the wheel

    Above him and beneath him

    Fifty thousand tons of steel


    [Verse 40]

    He looked over at his compass

    And he gazed into its face

    Needle pointing downward

    He knew he lost the race


    [Verse 41]

    In the dark illumination

    He remembered bygone years

    He read the Book of Revelation

    And he filled his cup with tears


    [Verse 42]

    When the Reaper''s task had ended

    Sixteen hundred had gone to rest

    The good, the bad, the rich, the poor

    The loveliest and the best


    [Verse 43]

    They waited at the landing

    And they tried to understand

    But there is no understanding

    For the judgment of God''s hand


    [Verse 44]

    The news came over the wires

    And struck with deadly force

    The love had lost its fires

    All things had run their course

    And the miners are having their big Christmas ball


    I''ll take you in a door and up a high stairs

    Singing and dancing is heard ev''rywhere

    I''ll let you shake hands with the people you see

    And watch the kids dance ''round the big Christmas tree


    There''s talking and laughing and songs in the air

    And the spirit of Christmas is there ev''rywhere

    Before you know it you''re friends with us all

    And you''re dancing around and around in the hall


    You ask about work and you ask about pay

    They''ll tell you they make less than a dollar a day

    Working their copper claims, risking their lives

    So it''s fun to spend Christmas with children and wives


    A little girl sits down by the Christmas tree lights

    To play the piano so you gotta keep quiet

    A few people rushed and there''s only a few

    "It''s just the thugs and the scabs fooling you."

    A man grabbed his daughter and he carried her down

    But the thugs held the door and he could not get out


    And then others followed, about a hundred or more

    We carried our children back up to their tree

    The scabs outside still laughed at their spree

  The Beaten Path (Introduction): "In 1974 I played the first of many shows with the\
    \ Band\u2014maybe in eight years. We were in a hockey arena in Chicago. There\
    \ were maybe 18,000 people there. The Band and I hadn\u2019t played publicly together\
    \ since 1966 where our shows caused a lot of disruption and turmoil\u2014a lot\
    \ of anger. Now we were in Chicago starting up again. There was no way to predict\
    \ what was going to happen. At the end of the concert we had played over 25 or\
    \ 30 songs and we were standing on the stage looking out. The audience was in\
    \ semi-darkness. All of a sudden, somebody lit a match. And then somebody else\
    \ lit another match. In short time, there were areas of the arena that were engulfed\
    \ in matches. Within seconds after that, it looked like the whole arena was in\
    \ flames and that all the people in the arena had struck matches and were going\
    \ to burn the place down. The Band and I looked for the nearest stage exit as\
    \ none of us wanted to go down in flames. It seemed like nothing had changed.\
    \ If we thought the response was extreme on the earlier tours we played, this\
    \ was positively apocalyptic. Every one of us on the stage thought that we\u2019\
    d really done it this time\u2014that the fans were going to burn the arena down.\
    \ Obviously we were wrong. We misinterpreted and misunderstood the reaction of\
    \ the crowd. What we believed to be disapproval was actually a grand appreciative\
    \ gesture. Appearances can be deceiving.\n\nFor this series of paintings, the\
    \ idea was to create pictures that would not be misinterpreted or misunderstood\
    \ by me or anybody else. When the Halcyon Gallery brought the idea of me doing\
    \ American landscapes for an exhibition, all they had to do was say it once. And\
    \ after a bit of clarification, I took it to heart and ran with it. The common\
    \ theme of these works having something to do with the American landscape\u2014\
    how you see it while crisscrossing the land and seeing it for what it\u2019s worth.\
    \ Staying out of the mainstream and traveling the back roads, free-born style.\
    \ I believe that the key to the future is in the remnants of the past. That you\
    \ have to master the idioms of your own time before you can have any identity\
    \ in the present tense. Your past begins the day you were born and to disregard\
    \ it is cheating yourself of who you really are.\n\nMy idea was to keep things\
    \ simple, only deal with what is externally visible. These paintings are up to\
    \ the moment realism\u2014archaic, most static, but quivering in appearance. They\
    \ contradict the modern world. However, that\u2019s my doing. The San Francisco\
    \ Chinatown street stands merely two blocks away from corporate, windowless buildings.\
    \ But these cold giant structures have no meaning for me in the world that I see\
    \ or choose to see or be a part of or gain entrance to. If you look half a block\
    \ away from the Coney Island hot-dog stand, the sky is littered with high rises.\
    \ I choose not to see them either. Down the road, across the highway from the\
    \ Cabin in the Woods is a manicured golf course. But it has little meaning compared\
    \ to the seemingly worthless shack which speaks to me. The Alabama Side Show is\
    \ surrounded by woods in all directions. The side show happens to be in a clearing\
    \ and you go there by dirt road. I chose to paint the side show instead of the\
    \ endless woods. There are countless other works where this is also true.\n\n\
    All the iconography is used in a semi-conscious way. I chose images because of\
    \ the meanings they have for me, and patterns can be seen in the repeating images\u2014\
    roads, shacks, piers, automobiles, streets, bayous, railroad tracks, bridges,\
    \ motels, truck stops, power lines, farmyards, theater marquees, churches, signs\
    \ and symbols, etc.\u2014all establishing a certain type of compositional value.\
    \ I would say the purpose is plain, non-experimental or exploratory.\n\nSome of\
    \ these works have much complexity of detail. Some are less demanding . . . in\
    \ some cases my hand couldn\u2019t do what my eye was perceiving. So I went to\
    \ the camera-obscura method. The camera obscura was a primitive camera invented\
    \ in the 1600s which projected an image upside down so the painter could work\
    \ from it. This was a real camera, but the image was not printable. It could only\
    \ be seen and filled in. Caravaggio used this in about all of his paintings and\
    \ so did Van Eyck and Vermeer. These days you don\u2019t have to go to all that\
    \ trouble. You can use a real camera. I put a 58-mm 0.43x wide-angle conversion\
    \ lens onto a used Nikon D3300 Af-p on quite a few paintings, Downtown Bank, Katz\u2019\
    s, Nathans, Russ & Daughters, Roy\u2019s, Blue Line, among others, and was able\
    \ to get the desired effect. If that didn\u2019t work, I used a convex Plexiglass\
    \ RCA 24 x 20 television screen that can be found in old junk shops and looked\
    \ at the world through that. On Curry Road in Arizona, I used an old movie frame,\
    \ and I did that on a couple of different paintings, too. In just as many others\
    \ I drew it straight on. Topanga Ranch, Ice Cream Factory, Truck Stops, Flat Top\
    \ Mt. Diner, and Del Rio Cantina. The method with the particular altered lens\
    \ was used for fullness of effect. In a lot of the other cases, all I needed was\
    \ a straight edge, compass, and a T square going on a case-by-case basis without\
    \ abandoning tradition or adhering to any conventions or aesthetic doctrines.\n\
    \nThe watercolors and acrylics done here purposely show little or no emotion,\
    \ yet I would say they are not necessarily emotionally stringent. The attempt\
    \ was made to represent reality and images as they are without idealizing them.\
    \ My idea is to compose works that create stability, working with generalized,\
    \ universal, and easily identifiable objects. Throughout, there is the attempt\
    \ to depict scenes of life and inanimate life for their own sake (Ice Cream Shack,\
    \ Arcade, Threatening Skies). Da Vinci paints a blurred picture\u2014you see no\
    \ lines but clouds that fade into one another with different color schemes. An\
    \ opposing view would be Mondrian and Van Gogh with strict lines that define the\
    \ volumes of space. In the middle somewhere would be Kandinsky and Rouault. And\
    \ these paintings would probably fall into that category.\n\nAn attempt was made\
    \ to depersonalize the works\u2014strip them of illusion. All the work is exclusively\
    \ placed in non-exotic settings within a rationally defined space. The focus points\
    \ are important and sometimes unusually placed. Background and foreground not\
    \ easily defined. In Amusement Park Alleyway, the focus point is the Ferris wheel\
    \ in the background. The orange Chevy truck might be centered in the foreground\
    \ but it\u2019s not the focal point. In Morning in Pittsburgh, the focal point\
    \ would be the bridge in the background instead of the larger warehouse in the\
    \ foreground. Just like in the Flat Top Diner, the focal point might actually\
    \ be the green trees.\n\nI tried to create the two dimensional image using a mathematical\
    \ system. At times, the background and foreground converge. Natural scenery is\
    \ always the main feature. These are not crowded compositions. They are using\
    \ basic structures to express feelings and ideas. Perfect proportion and logic\
    \ instead of emotion. The nature of beauty, the lines, forms, shape, and texture\
    \ that emphasize the recognizable create harmony where natural scenery is the\
    \ main feature.\n\nI restricted myself to traditional subject matter, viewing\
    \ nothing as shallow or gaudy. A simple hot-dog stand can have classical features,\
    \ and I view it as such (Donut Shop, High Wire). Whiplash curves, flying buttresses,\
    \ pointed steeples, arches, and waves. They are all there, reflecting any time\
    \ period, purposely trying to stay away from dramatic or theatrical lighting effects,\
    \ bringing naturalism to the forefront.\n\nIn some paintings, the brightness of\
    \ reflected light was brought forth in evident brushstrokes. Sometimes sunlight\
    \ hitting certain places would contrast deeply with areas of shadow (Sunset on\
    \ the Prairie, Threatening Skies). I tried to avoid skewed perspectives or man-made\
    \ light, yet sometimes it couldn\u2019t be avoided. An expert painter is a master\
    \ in color theory, which means he can turn white into black using a complex value\
    \ system of colors and hues like a Mark Rothko. \u201CThe Beaten Path\u201D however,\
    \ reflects explorations in color, sometimes using colors that become less pronounced\
    \ and outlines that become less precise. Other times tipping toward the monochromatic\
    \ (Oil Rigger\u2019s Shack, Twilight After Dusk).\n\nFlowing or curved lines form\
    \ another visual vehicle, suggesting a far distance in a landscape painting. Architecture\
    \ itself is always a vital source of ideas and inspiration, but, always, \u201C\
    The Beaten Path\u201D tries to return to the traditional methods of perceptions\u2014\
    things that are perceived in the visible world\u2014taking the three dimensional\
    \ into a two dimensional format using contrast, location, isolation, and convergence.\n\
    \nIf there is a soundtrack to this compilation of paintings, I would say it could\
    \ be recordings by Peetie Wheatstraw in some places, Charlie Parker in others,\
    \ Clifford Brown or Blind Lemon, maybe Guitar Slim\u2014artists that make us a\
    \ lot bigger when listening to them. It would have to be that way. Absolutely.\n\
    \nThere was a conscious attempt to dismiss consumer culture or popular culture,\
    \ including mass media, commercial art, celebrities, consumer or product packaging,\
    \ billboard signs, comic strips, magazine advertising. \u201CThe Beaten Path\u201D\
    \ works represent a different subject matter from the everyday imagery of consumer\
    \ culture. There is nothing to suggest these paintings were inspired by the writings\
    \ of Sigmund Freud or that they were based on any mental images that occur in\
    \ dreams, no fantasy worlds, religious mysticism or ambiguous subject matter.\
    \ In every picture the viewer doesn\u2019t have to wonder whether it\u2019s an\
    \ actual object or a delusional one. If the viewer visited where the picture actually\
    \ existed, he or she would see the same thing. It is what unites us all.See Bob\

    Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay

    In fields where they lay a-keeping their sheep

    On a cold winter''s night that was so deep


    [Refrain]

    Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel

    Born is the King of Israel


    [Verse 2]

    They looked up and saw a star

    Shining in the east beyond them far

    And to the earth it gave great light

    And so it continued both day and night


    [Refrain]

    Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel

    Born is the King of Israel

    This by the light of that same star

    Three wise men came from country far

    To seek for a King was their intent

    And to follow the star wherever it went

  They Killed Him: '[Verse 1]

    Another man from Atlanta, Georgia

    By name of Martin Luther King

    He shook the land like the rolling thunder

    And made the bells of freedom ring today

    With a dream of beauty that they could not burn away

    Just another holy man who dared to make a stand

    My God, they killed him

    The only Son of God Almighty

    The holy one called Jesus Christ

    As to be by the touch of your skin

    Your magnetic movements still capture the minutes I''m in


    But it''s grieving my heart, love

    To see you tryin'' to be a part of

    A world that just don''t exist

    It''s all just a scheme, babe

    A vacuum, a dream, babe

    That sucks you into feelin'' like this


    I''ve heard you say many times

    That you''re better than no one

    And no one is better than you

    You''ll starve to death on the prairie and also lose your pay."

    Her fond face pale with woe

    Her heart will be broken when I am gone

    I''ll see her soon, I know."

    Just then the order came to charge

    For an instance hand touched hand

    They said, "Aye," and away they rode

    That brave and devoted band


    [Verse 3]

    Straight was the track to the top of the hill

    The rebels they shot and shelled

    Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks

    And guarded them as they fell

    There soon came a horrible dying yell

    From heights that they could not gain

    And those whom doom and death had spared

    Rode slowly back again

  Up on Cripple Creek: 'When I get off of this mountain, you know where I want to
    go?

    Straight down the Mississippi river, to the Gulf of Mexico

    To Lake Charles, Louisiana, little Bessie, girl that I once knew

    She told me just to come on by, if there''s anything she could do


    Up on Cripple Creek she sends me

    If I spring a leak she mends me

    I don''t have to speak, she defends me

    A drunkard''s dream if I ever did see one


    Good luck had just stung me, to the race track I did go

    She bet on one horse to win and I bet on another to show

    The odds were in my favor, I had ''em five to one

    When that nag to win came around the track, sure enough she had won


    Up on Cripple Creek she sends me

    If I spring a leak she mends me

    I don''t have to speak, she defends me

    A drunkard''s dream if I ever did see one


    I took up all of my winnings, and I gave my little Bessie half

    She tore it up and threw it in my face, just for a laugh

    Now there''s one thing in the whole wide world, I sure would like to see

    That''s when that little love of mine, dips her doughnut in my tea


    Up on Cripple Creek she sends me

    If I spring a leak she mends me

    were back at the shack, we had Spike Jones on the box

    She said, "I can''t take the way he sings, but I love to hear him talk"

    Now that just gave my heart a throb, to the bottom of my feet

    And I swore as I took another pull, my Bessie can''t be beat


    Up on Cripple Creek she sends me

    If I spring a leak she mends me

    I don''t have to speak, she defends me

    A drunkard''s dream if I ever did see one


    Now there''s a flood out in California and up north it''s freezing cold

    And this living on the road is getting pretty old

    So I guess I''ll call up my big mama, tell her I''ll be rolling in

    But you know, deep down, I''m kind of tempted to go and see my Bessie again

  Up to Me (9/19/74, Take 2, Remake): "[Verse 1]\nEverything went from bad to worse,\

    \ that nothing had changed that much\nThe old Rounder in the iron mask slipped\
    \ me the master key\nSomebody had to unlock your heart, he said it was up to me\n\
    \n[Verse 5]\nWell, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers\u2019\

  Visions of Johanna: '[Verse 1]

    Ain''t it just like the night to play

    Tricks when you''re trying to be so quiet?

    We sit here stranded

    Though we''re all doing our best to deny it

    And Louise holds a handful of rain, tempting you to defy it

    Lights flicker from the opposite loft

    In this room the heat pipes just cough

    The country music station plays soft

    But there''s nothing, really nothing to turn off

    Just Louise and her lover so entwined

    And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind


    [Verse 2]

    In the empty lot where the ladies play

    Blindman''s bluff with the key chain

    And the all-night girls

    They whisper of escapades out on the "D" train

    We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight

    Ask himself if it''s him or them that''s insane

    Louise, she''s all right, she''s just near

    She''s delicate and seems like the mirror

    But she just makes it all too concise and too clear

    That Johanna''s not here

    The ghost of ''lectricity howls in the bones of her face

    Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place

    See Bob Dylan LiveGet tickets as low as $57You might also like[Verse 3]

    Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously

    He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously

    And when bringing her name up

    He speaks of a farewell kiss to me

    He''s sure got a lotta gall

    To be so useless and all

    Muttering small talk at the wall while I''m in the hall

    Oh, how can I explain?

    It''s so hard to get on

    And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn


    [Verse 4]

    Inside the museums, Infinity goes up on trial

    Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while"

    But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues

    You can tell by the way she smiles

    See the primitive wallflower freeze

    When the jelly-faced women all sneeze

    Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez, I can''t find my knees"

    Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule

    But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel


    [Verse 5]

    The peddler now speaks

    To the countess who''s pretending to care for him

    Sayin'', "Name me someone that''s not a parasite

    And I''ll go out and say a prayer for him"

    But like Louise always says

    "You can''t look at much, can you, man?"

    As she, herself, prepares for him

    And Madonna, she still has not showed

    We see this empty cage now corrode

    Where her cape of the stage once had flowed

    The fiddler, he now steps to the road

    He writes everything''s been returned which was owed

    On the back of the fish truck that loads

    While my conscience explodes

    The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain

    And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain11'

  When the Deal Goes Down: '[Verse 1]

    Where wisdom grows up in strife

    The midnight rain follows the train

    We all wear the same thorny crown

    Soul to soul, our shadows roll

    And I''ll be with you when the deal goes down

    The moon gives light and shines by night

    I scarcely feel the glow

    We learn to live and then we forgive

    O''er the road we''re bound to go

  White Dove: 'In the deep rolling hills of old Virginia

    There''s a place that I love so well

    Where I spent many days of my childhood

    In the cabin where we loved to dwell

    White dove will mourn in sorrow

    The willows will hang their heads

    I''ll live my life in sorrow

    Since mother and daddy are dead

    We were all so happy there together

    In our peaceful little mountain home

    But the Savior needs angels up in heaven

    Now they sing around the great white throne

    As the years roll by I often wonder

    If we will all be together someday

    And each night as I wander through the graveyard

  "\u2019Cross the Green Mountain": 'I cross the green mountain, I slept by the stream

    Heaven blazin'' in my head, I dreamt a monstrous dream

    Somethin'' came up out of the sea

    Swept through the land of the rich and the free


    I look into the eyes of my merciful friend

    And then I ask myself, is this the end?

    Memories linger, sad yet sweet

    And I think of the souls in heaven who will meet


    Altars are burnin'' with flames far and wide

    The foe has crossed over from the other side

    They tip their caps from the top of the hill

    You can feel them come, more brave blood to spill


    Along the dim Atlantic line

    The ravaged land lies for miles behind

    The light''s comin'' forward and the streets are broad

    All must yield to the avengin'' God


    The world is old, the world is gray

    Lessons of life can''t be learned in a day

    I watch and I wait and I listen while I stand

    To the music that comes from a far better land


    Close the eyes of our captain, peace may he know

    His long night is done, the great leader is laid low

    He was ready to fall, he was quick to defend

    Killed outright he was, by his own men

    last hour of the last happy year

    I feel that the unknown world is so near

    Pride will vanish and glory will rot

    But virtue lives and cannot be forgot


    The bells of the evening have rung

    There''s blasphemy on every tongue

    Let ''em say that I walked in fair nature''s light

    And that I was loyal to truth and to right


    Serve God and be cheerful, look upward, beyond

    Beyond the darkness of masks, the surprises of dawn

    In the deep green grasses of the blood stained wood

    They never dreamed of surrenderin'', they fell where they stood


    Stars fell over Alabama, I saw each star

    You''re walkin'' in dreams, whoever you are

    Chilled are the skies, keen is the frost

    The grounds froze hard and the morning is lost


    A letter to mother came today

    Gun shot wound to the breast is what it did say

    But he''ll be better soon, he''s in a hospital bed

    But he''ll never be better, he''s already dead


    I''m ten miles outside the city and I''m lifted away

    In an ancient light that is not of day

    They were calm, they were blunt, we knew ''em all too well

    We loved each other more than we ever dared to tell'
  "\u2019Til I Fell in Love with You (Version 1)": '[Verse 1]

    Well, my head''s out of order

    Ain''t taking any calls

    You got any messages

    Put ''em on the wall

    I''ve been hit too hard

    I''ve seen too much

    Nothing around here

    That I want to touch


    [Chorus]

    Don''t know what I''m gonna do

    Doin'' alright ''til I fell in love with you


    [Verse 2]

    Well, loneliness

    Got a mind of its own

    The more people around

    The more you feel alone

    But I know God

    Will hold the charge

    Faith can cut you

    Right to the heart


    [Chorus]

    Just don''t know what I''m

    Gonna do

    I was doin'' alright until

    Fell in love with you

    Sometimes my words

    Don''t do no good

    Gotta talk a different language

    To be understood

    Maybe you talk about it

    And you feel alive

    It''s a miracle

    If you can just survive


    [Chorus]

    Don''t know what I''m

    Gonna do

    I was doin'' alright ''til

    Fell in love with you

    Fell in love with you'
